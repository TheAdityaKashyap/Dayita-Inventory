During certain periods in the\nsummer and ina tropical climate sutficiently low relative humidity can be maintained by air\ndehumiditication If the electrodes have been stored in a cold place allow them to reach\nambient temperature before breaking the package\nVacPac\nElectrodes in VacPac will not pick up any moisture during storage. They require no re-drying\nbefore use provided the package is undamaged. This is indicated by the vacuum in the\npackage.\nRe-drying\nLow-hydrogen basic electrodes should be re-dried before use whenever there are\napplication requirements relating to weld metal hydrogen content and radiographic\nsoundness (not needed for VacPac). Acid rutile stainless electrodes and all types of basic\nelectrode may produce pores in the weld if they have not been stored in sufficiently dry\nconditions. Re-drying the electrodes will restore their usability Mild steel rutile and acid\nelectrodes normally require no re-drying.

Agglomerated fluxes must be protected from moisture pick-up.\nre-drying agglomerated fluxes at specified in product label before use is recommended. The\nremaining flux in the welding machine container should be removed and stored in a dry\ncabinet and should therefore not be feftin the open container.\n2. The fusion faces and the plate in the vicinity of the joint should be clean and dry. The\ncleaner the joint the better the chances of obtaining a satisfactory weld. Rust mill scale\npaint oil and residue from arc-air gouging or grinding can adversely affect the quality of the\nweld metal. The more impurities on the fusion faces the greater the risk of weld metal\ndefects.\n3. The arc voltage must be kept constant. Increased arc voltage results in higher flux\nconsumption. If the flux contains alloying elements the amount transferred to theweld metal\nwillincrease as the are voltage increases.\nThe mechanical properties are obtained according to the welding conditions given in\napplicable standards such as EN ISO  AWS\n91 9833550505 www.dnhSecheron.com\n"
