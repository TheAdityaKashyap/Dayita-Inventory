Welds are of radiographic quality. The weld metal\ndisplays good crack resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing excellent\nstrength combined with good impact properties at subzero temperature. It is suitable for\njoining many high strength low alloy or micro alloyed steels to themselves or to lower\nstrength steels including carbon steels. Ideally suited for welding earth moving\nequipments and other heavy equipments."
