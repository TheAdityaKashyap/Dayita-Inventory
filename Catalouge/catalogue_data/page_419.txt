Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-310 is stainless steel flux cored wire designed for optimum performance with
LO0%%CO gas shielding. This wire is designed with fast freezing slag characteristics and
food slag detachability. The wire welds satisfactorily in out of position and performs
equally well when welding in the flat  horizontal position. The weld metal is of
radiographic quality resistant to cracking and very good oxidation  scaling resistant at
elevated temperature. Maxfil-310 is designed for welding of AISI 410 steels or similar
compositions such as ovens boilers and thermal equipment for heat treatment chemical
and petrochemical installations.
