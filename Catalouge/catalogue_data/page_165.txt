Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  9015-B92
Characteristics  Applications 
Alow hydrogen non synthetic electrode deposits 9%Cr-0.5%Mo-1.7%W and enriched with
Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen. Tungsten additions provides adequate creep rupture
strength at higher steam pressures and temperatures The controlled addition of alloying
elements improves the toughness and weldability. It is designed to weld advanced
materials which are being used to improve thermal efficiency in power plant refineries
ete. Ideal for welding steels of similar composition to achieve adequate creep rupture
strength. Some typical materials that are welded with this consumable are A215 T932
AdS6 P92 ASSTGr 92 ete.
