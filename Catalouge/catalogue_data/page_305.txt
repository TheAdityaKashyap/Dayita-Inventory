Characteristics  Applications 
Weld metal from DH NM-Cl is not readily machinable. It is the most economical for
repairing various types of cast ron where machinability of the weld deposit is not required
where weld shrinkage stress is not a concern and color match of the base metal should not
be expected. It melts at relatively low temperatures which permit the use of low welding
currents. Commonly used on gears motor housings machine parts farm equipment large
fames etc.

Precautions 
1. Clean the base material thoroughly free from any surface contamination.
2. Machine or chamfer the casting skin from weld area.
8. Uselow current stringer beads and short weld runs followed by peening.
Over heating of casting should be avoided by putting intermittent weld beads
Allow the weld to cool slowly.
