Characteristics  Applications 
DH 385-17 is a stainless steel electrode which exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion
In non oxidizing media like sulfuric acid phosphoric acid acetic acid formic acid fatty
acids oxalic acid etc. It works well with transformer and good restriking characteristic
Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal
fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. Iris particularly suited for welding Carpenter 20 HV9 HV9A Uranus B6 VHB
9041. Sandvik 2RKG65 and similar materials which are used for these service conditions.
