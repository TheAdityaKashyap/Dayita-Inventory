Characteristics  Applications 
DH 307-1513 a basic coated electrode depositing a stainless steel weld metal
having 20%Cr-10%Ni-4.0%Mn-1.0%Mo. The weld metal possess high crack resistant with
moderate strength. t is ideally suited for moderate strength welds with good crack
resistance between dissimilar steels such as austenitic manganese steel and carbon steel
forgings or castings.
