Autotherme Cr-Mo 1 is copper-coated a solid wire for GMAW vielding 9%Cr - 1%Mo and
modified with Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen designed to provide improved creep
strength toughness fatigue life oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated
temperatures. The wire gives stable arc smooth welding performance and deposits
radiographic quality welds. lt is designed to weld the materials in power plant refineries
naptha cracker units ete Following are some of the steels that can be welded with this
wire 1) Plate A387 Gr.f1 (I) Pipes A 335-P91 (111) Tubes.4213-T91
