Characteristics  Applications 
Rutox-Mo is a stainless steel electrode depositing a weld metal containing 18%0Cr-11%Ni-
2.3Mlo The weld metal displays good crack resistance excellent creep strength and
resists scaling at elevated temperatures up to 850C The weld metal has excellent
resistance to corrosion and pitting. Ideal for joining wrought and cast material of similar
composition
