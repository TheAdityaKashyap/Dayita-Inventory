Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2595-15(NS) is a non-synthetic basic coated electrode depositing super duplex
stainless steel weld metal. The weld metal exhibits high strength and resistance to stress
corrosion cracking pitting and crevice corrosion tis ideally suited for welding of super
duplex stainless steels UNS 532550 532750 and S32760 (wrought) and UNS J93370
J95380 J94404 CD4MCuNicast) and similar compositions. Examples of application
areas are Oil and gas industry Oil country tubular Food processing Valves and fittings
Flue gas de-sulfurizers Off shore platforms Petrochemical plants Mechanical and
structural components.

Precautions 
Ll. Redry the electrodes at 250-3006C for  hour.
2. The heat input should be in the range of5-15 Kd/mm
3. Please ensure inter pass temperature is less than 150C and better less than 102C
4. For better results solution annealing at 1080-11 20C is required.
