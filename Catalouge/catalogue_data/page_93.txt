ULTRATENSAL-Cu 2322
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5 y 9018-G
Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated extra low hydrogen electrode. The weld metal displays excellent crack
resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing excellent strength combined with
good impact properties at sub-zero temperature. Ideally suited for welding of high
atrength QT steels ike WEL TEN 80 54.517 grades WB36 pipes and their equivalent
frades. Welding highly restrained joints in high strength steels under site conditions with
relative humidity since the extra low hydrogen content of the weld metal helps preventing
hydrogen induced cracking.

Precautions 
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 400C for 01 hour.
Ensure cleanliness of the surface to be welded.
Use short arc and minimum heat input. The preheat and Inter pass temperature shall
never be more than 150C
