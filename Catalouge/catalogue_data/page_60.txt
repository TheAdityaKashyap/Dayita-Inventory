Characteristics  Applications 
A medium coated general purpose all position mild steel electrode for welding low carbon
and mild structural steels. It gives radiographic quality weld metal. The electrode
operates with a quiet arc and deposits a smooth bead with fine ripples. The slag is easily
detachable. The electrode produces minimum spatter and has good striking and re-
striking characteristics. The electrode operates well under low OCY transformers. Typical
appheations include welding of steel structures tanks truck frames and bodies
machinery construction auto bodies frames pipes ete.
