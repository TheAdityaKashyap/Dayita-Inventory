Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme Cr-Mo 2 is-a copper-coated solid wire for GMAW available in bright finish.
The wire pives stable arc smooth welding performances and deposits radiographic quality
welds. tis suitable for welding 225%(Cr-1%Mo steel. The weld metal possesses good high
temperature properties. t deposits notch free weld deposit with excellent mechanical
properties Especially suitable for welding of pipes and tubes of matching composition in
Power plants Refineries Petrochemicals Fertilizer plants ete. Suitable for welding of
ASTM steels Grade F22 (class 1  3) of SA-182 and SA-386 Grade T4 T22 of SA-199
Grade T22 of SA-214 Grade WC9 of SA-217 Grade P22 of SA-335 Grade FP22 of SA-269
