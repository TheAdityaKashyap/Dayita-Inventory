Characteristics  Applications 
Non-synthetic electrode for joining repair and surfacing to resist abrasion corrosion
oxidation and high temperature service. Weld metal containing low carbon Cr-Ma-W-Co.
Excellent resistance to heat strength and toughness up to 1000C Weld metal has good
thermal shock resistance hardness retention even at elevated temperatures and work
hardening characteristics. deal for welding low carbon Ni-Cr-Mo alloys clad side of low
carbon Ni-Cr-Mo alloys and alloys of similar composition. Ideal for valves valve seats
impellers zuide points bushing bearing journals hot working tools like hot shear blades
forging dies trimming dies piercing punches ete.

Precautions 
l. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300-325C for 1 hour.
2. Use short arc stringer bead and smallest possible size of electrode and minimum
current to reduce the heat input.
