SIA-Mo Der
Characteristics  Applications
SLA-Mo is a special stainless steel electrode depositing a stainless steel weld metal having
19% Cr-9.N1-6%Min-0.4 Mio. The weld metals highly crack resistant and tts unique
mechanical properties are maintained even when welding steels of different compositions.
Itis ideally suited for welding HSLA steels like armour steels etc in cast or rolled forms It
is also useful for welding materials of similar composition austenitic manganese steel and
for producing stainless eteel overlay for corrosion resistance buffer layers for hard facing
and work hardenable deposits.
