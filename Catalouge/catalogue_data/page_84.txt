TENSAL-MH(R) 22%
Codification 
AWS SPA 5.5  E9018M H4R
Characteristics  Applications 
Tensal-MH(R) is hydrogen controlled basic coated moisture resistant. electrode
depositing a high strength weld metal. The electrode possesses excellent operating
characteristics and 1s suitable for welding in all positions The extra low hydrogen content
reduces susceptibility from hydrogen induced cracking. The weld metal possesses high
strength together with good notch toughness. Ideally suited for welding fine-grained
steels high strength steele. QT steels used in the fabrication of structures bridges
penstocks and other components.
