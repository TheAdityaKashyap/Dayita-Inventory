AUTOTHERME GRADE-N 22322
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Copper coated 0Cr-1.0%Mo solid wire for submerged arc welding. These wires are
suitable for welding of Creep resistance and similar composition high strength steels.
Autotherme grade-N solid wire suitable for welding of similar grade creep steels. The weld
metal possesses good high temperature properties. It deposits notch free weld deposit with
excellent mechanical properties especially suitable for welding of pipes and tubes of
matching compositions in power plants Refineries Petrochemicals Fertilizer etc
