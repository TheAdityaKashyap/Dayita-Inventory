Characteristics  Applications 
Cellutherme-Mo is a light coated cellulosic type electrodes. The electrodes are
characterized by a deeply penetrating forceful spray type arc and readily removable
thin friable slag. Ideally suited for welding in all positions including vertical down. Ideal
for stove pipe technique and faster welding. Welds are of radiographic quality Electrode is
designed to yield a weld deposit containing 0.4Mo and therefore is suitable for welding C-
0.5% Mo steels. It is ideally suited for root pass welding of API 5L X42 to KOO grades
Typical applications include welding of pipes tubes ducts ete.
