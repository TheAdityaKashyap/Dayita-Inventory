EN ISO 636-4 W 46 6 2Niz
Characteristics  Applications 
F 808-Ni2 is a copper-coated solid wire available in bright finish gives amooth flow stable
arc and spatter ree under optimum welding conditions. It is specially designed to produce
weld metal with increase strength and notch toughness at temperature up to -60C It
gives radiographic quality welds Ideally suitable for welding fine grained and Nickel
steels. Typical applications include containers and piping systems and tanks used for
storage transportation of liquefied propane and butane AP brackets ete.
