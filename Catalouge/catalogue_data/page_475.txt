Characteristics  Applications 
Maxflux SAF-8 (LS) is an agglomerated Muoride-basic type Mux suitable to weld medium
to high strength steels. The weld metal made with this flux gives very low diffusible
hydrogen content good crack resistance and higher sub-zero toughness properties The
flux is neutral in Mn  3i pick up and meets mechanical requirements after post-weld heat
treatment at 620C upto six hours of holding. The weld deposit is of radiographic quality.
The weld metal passes the corrosion tests as per NACE standard TM-01-77  TM-02-84.
Maxflux SAF-8 (LS) is suitable for single  multi-layer welding of high tensile quenched 
tempered steel fine grained steels heat resistant structural steels nuclear sector
