Complete Welding Support
OUR PROFILE
elevated temperatures up to 1100C It is ideally
suitable for welding of stainless steels of similar
composition like ASTM 530815.
Cromotherme-1(RTE) Weld metal having strict
control on 8 P As Sn  Sb will improve the subzero
impact Property and resists temper embrittlement.
Ideal for welding steam generating equipments and
reactor vessels.
Indotherme-H4R Basic coated low hydrogen
moisture resistance electrode with vacuumpack.
Tensal (MOD) Special low hydrogen type electrodes.
The weld metal possesses high strength together with
good notch toughness even at subzero temperatures
down to -50C. Ideally suited for welding fine-grained
steels high strength steels QT steels used in the
fabrication of structures bridges penstocks earth
moving equipments other materials like DIRSO
SOQOHT heat exchangers ete.
Cromotherme-91W A low hydrogen electrode
deposits 9%Cr-0.5%Mo-1.75%W micro alloyed with
Niobium Vanadium Nitrogen and Boron. Tungsten
additions provides adequate creep rupture strength at
higher steam pressures and temperatures The
controlled addition of micro alloying elements
increased the high temperature strength and creep
behaviour. t is designed to weld advanced power
plant materials like boiler super heater and re-heater
tubes. It is also used for header and steam piping for
extremely severe steam conditions. The typical
materials that are welded with this consumable are
A213 T92 A335 P92 A387 Gr 92 etc.
Nimotherme-1(Spl) Low hydrogen iron powder
electrode depositing 1%Ni-0.25%Mo weld metal.
Confirming to E8018-C3 class. Ideally suited for
welding grain refined steels and nickel steels for
service temperatures down to -60C Typical
applications include storage tanks for liquefied gases
