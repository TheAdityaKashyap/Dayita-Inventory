DH FN
Characteristics  Applications 
DH FN is a special Ferro -Nickel electrode designed for repair welds os well ag for joining
components of various types of cast rons including grey and nodular cast trons and for
welding them to steel and some ferrous and non-ferrous materials. Weld metal have good
machinability.t ia the right electrode for repair welds as well as for joining components
and parts made out of various types of cast irons rectification of defective casting in cast
iron foundry engine heads pump casings impellers rope drums ingot moulds and a
variety of cast iron machine parts and equipments. It is also suitable for welding cast iron
to steel and some ferrous and non-ferrous materials.

Precautions 
1. Re-dry the electrodes at 100C for 1 hour.
Grind the area to be welded so that the casting skin is removed.
Clean the area free from all contaminates by degreasing burning brushing grinding
ete
Ifa crack has to be repaired drill crack arrester holes at the end of the cracks. Remove
the crack completely by gouging grinding ete. and ensure complete removal by a dye
penetrant test
Deposit the welds in small lengths of 50mm ata time.
Peen the welds.
After welding allow the casting to cool slowly.
These are the general steps in cast iron welding However the procedures may have to
be modified depending on the job.
