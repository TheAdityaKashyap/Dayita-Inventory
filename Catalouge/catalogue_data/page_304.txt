Characteristics  Applications 
DH 111101 is an electrode depositing a ferro-nickel alloy weld metal ideal for welding of
several types of cast irons and components for producing strong crack free with good
toughness weld joints. The weld deposit has good machinability and good colour match
with the parent metal tis ideally suited for joining cast iron to mild steel
