Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 312-17 1s a stainless steel electrode for welding similar composition and dissimilar
metals. It works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic Better welder
appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds
produce more of spray arc anda finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat
to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no porosity. The
weld metal is highly resistant to crack and fissures. These electrodes were designed to
weld cast alloys of similar composition. The typical application include welding dissimilar
metals unknown metals leaf and coil springs gear teeth forged shafts earth moving
equipment and machine parts.
