Characteristics  Applications 
FW 1423 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit. Weld metal enhanced resistance to pitting crevice corrosion and stress corrosion
cracking. t has outstanding corrosion resistance to both reducing and oxidizing media It
is suitable for welding Nickel  Chromium  Molybdenum alloy to itself to steel to other
nickel base alloys and for cladding eteel. Typical applications include the welding of Nickel
Chromium  Molybdenum allovs such as ASTM B574 8575 B619 B622  BG28 having
UNS number N 06023.
