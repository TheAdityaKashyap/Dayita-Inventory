AUTOTHERME GRADEV 2222
Compile Welding Support
EN SO 24598-B SUsCIM
Characteristics  Applications 
Autoherme Gr- (9%Cr-1%Mo) ia. a copper coated solid wire for the submerged are welding
of medium and high strength estructural steels. These wires are suitable for welding of
creep resistance and similar composition high strength steels. The weld metal possesses
good high temperature properties. It deposits sound weld with excellent mechanical
properties especially suitable for welding of pipes and tubes of matching compositions in
power plants Refineries Petrochemicals Fertilizer etc. Suitable for welding of ASTM
steels Al82-F9 AS36-F9 A1l99-TS AZO0-TO AZ13-To Ad35-Po ASG9-FPO A217-C12
