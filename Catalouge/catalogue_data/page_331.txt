Characteristics  Applications 
F (-Mo is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish. The wire gives
atable arc smooth welding performances and deposits radiographic quality welds. It is
ideally suited for welding of low alloy ferritic steels of similar composition. The weld metal
possesses good high temperature properties. Typical applications include the welding of
Carbon Molybdenum steels such as ASTM Grade Fl of SA-182  54-336 Grade A of SA-
204 Grade T1/Tla/T1b of SA-209 Grade WC1 of SA-217 Grade A of SA-302 Grade P1 of
A4-335 Class 1 of A grades of SA-533 ete.
