AWS SPA 5.5  B9015-B3
Characteristics  Applications 
Weld metal having strict control on 8 FP As 8n  Sb will improve the sub-zero impact
property and resists temper embrittlement. Weld metal retains ita mechanical properties
after prolonged heat treatments. Ideal for welding steam generating equipments and
reactor vessels. The weld metal displays excellent tensile strength and ereep resistance.
Specially applicable wherever temper embrittlement resistance is required
