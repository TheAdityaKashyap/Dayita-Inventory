OUR PROFILE
DH 953 Special hardfacing electrode for Nitrided
dies.
The covering of 17 stainless steel electrodes
introduced. These are modification of the 16 covering.
On horizontal fillet welds electrodes with a 17
covering tend to produce more of a spray are and a
finer rippled weld-bead surface.
Ultratensal-Cu It is a basic coated extra low
hydrogen electrode. Ideally suited for welding of high
strength QT steels like WEL TEN 80 SA 517
grades WB36 and their equivalent grades
Cellutherme-P80 It has been designed primarily for
welding typical high strength pipe butt joints in the
vertical welding position with downward or upward
progression. Conforming to E8010-P1.
Molytherme-G It is a low hydrogen electrode
yielding a weld deposit containing Mn-Mo. The
electrode is ideally suited for welding SA 302 Gr.B
steels  similar composition materials.
Wear plate and complete full-fledged automated job
work work shop established.
Cromotherme-91Non-synthetie electrode depositing
weld metal of 9%Cr-1%Mo modified with Al V Nb
and N for welding P91 materials. Conforming to
E9015-B9 classification.
Cromotherme-92 A low hydrogen electrode deposits
9%Cr-1%oMo and enriched with Niobium Vanadium
Nitrogen and tungsten. Some typical materials where
this electrode can be used are P92 Rotor Steel E911
steels GA12 Cr MoWVNbW Lletc.
DH 2209 (NS) Ideal for welding duplex stainless
steels. The weld metal possesses excellent corrosion
resistance in marine  paper environments Suitable
for welding duplex stainless steels having Cr  25%
and other grades like UNS 32205 UNS 31808 ete.
