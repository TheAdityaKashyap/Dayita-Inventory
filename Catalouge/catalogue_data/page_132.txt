Characteristics  Applications 
Extra low hydrogen type electrodes depositing a high strength weld metal. The electrode
possesses excellent operating characteristics and is surtable for welding in all positions.
Weld metal has got good toughness even at subzero temperatures Deposition efficiency 1s
about 115%. The weld metal possesses high strength together with good notch toughness
even at subzero temperatures down to -50C Ideally suited for welding fine-grained
steels high etrength steels IS 8500-91 Gr 540B STOB S90B IS 2002-92 Gr.s IS 1875-
92 clase SA or similar.
