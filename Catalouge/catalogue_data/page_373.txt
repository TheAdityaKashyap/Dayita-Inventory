Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-MC-31 is a gas shielded metal-cored wire designed for welding of low  medium
tensilo steels structures subjected to dynamic loading. The wire encompasses the
deposition advantages of flux cored wire along with the high deposition efficiencies of a
solid wire with both single and multi-layer applications. The deposited weld metal is
virtually free from slag covering and thus reduces post-weld cleaning time. The wire burns
with smooth arc and low spatter Weld metal contains extremely low diffusible hydrogen
(dm per 100gm). Maxfil-MC-31 15 suitable for welding of similar composition sine ls and
equivalent prade si  DEIFIG grades of SA-414 Gr.60/Gr.65 steels of SA-515
Gr.60/Gr.65 steels of SA-516 etc. The wire can be used for robotic welding applications
