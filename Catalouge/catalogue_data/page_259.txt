Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2594-17(N8) is a non-synthetic electrode depositing super duplex stainless steel
weld metal. Electrode works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic.
Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics On horizontal
fillet welds produce more of spray are and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave thas no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. The weld metal exhibits high strength high impact energy and resistance to
stress corrosion cracking pitting and crevice corrosion. t is ideal for welding duplex and
super duplex stainless steels. The weld metal possesses excellent corrosion resistance in
marine  paper environments Examples of application areas are Oil and gas industry
Off shore plat forms Petrochemical plants Mechanical and structural ete.
