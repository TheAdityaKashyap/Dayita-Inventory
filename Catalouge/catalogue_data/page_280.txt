SUPER-Mn

Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Super-Mn is an electrode depositing high manganese steel weld metal. The weld metal
possesses excellent toughness and work hardens under impact. The deposit exhibits an
austenitic structure and is ideally suited for re-surfacing austenitic manganese steel
components like crusher jaws hammers etc for resistance against wear by impact and
abrasion.

Precautions 
Ensure the surface to be built-up is free of all contaminants.
Remove by grinding any work hardened zone. A magnet can detach a work hardened
Zone.
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 200-250C for 1 hour.
When welding on austenitic manganese steels restrict heat input by 
a) Short arc
b) Stringer bead
c) Deposits of short lengths and thickness
d) Intermittent welding
e) Keeping base material partly immersed in water.
