Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
A heavy coated hydrogen controlled all conventional position electrode depositing low
alloy weld metal. The electrode gives soft  smooth are which is easy to strike  re-strike
Superior operating characteristics with easy slag detachability. The welds are of
radiographic quality. For surfacing of hot forging dies. For repairs of large hot working
dies and earth moving equipments made of high tensile steel. Repair of case hardening
steel parts after removing the hard zones for repairing cracks in Ni-Cr hot working dies
