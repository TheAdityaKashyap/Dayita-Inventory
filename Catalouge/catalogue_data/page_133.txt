Characteristics  Applications 
Extra low hydrogen type electrodes depositing a high strength weld metal. The electrode
possesses excellent operating characteristics and is suitable for welding in all positions.
Weld metal has got good toughness even at subzero temperatures. Deposition efficiency 15
about 115% min. The weld metal possesses high strength together with good notch
toughness even at subzero temperatures down to -50C. Ideally suited for welding
components made of steel to 1S2062 Gr. E410 E450 82002-Gra 151875-04 clase 3A or
similar.
