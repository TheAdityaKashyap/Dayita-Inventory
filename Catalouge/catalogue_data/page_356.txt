Characteristics  Applications 
FW 385 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives amooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit Wire contains low carbon 20%%Cr-25%Ni- 5%Mo-2%%Cu which exhibits excellent
resistance ta corrosion in non oxidizing media like sulfuric acid phosphoric acid acetic
acid formic acid fatty acids oxalic acid etc. t is ideally suited for welding materials for
application where phosphoric sulfuric acids and other non oxidizing solutions are
encountered. The addition of Mo and Cu helps in resisting corrosive attack of these
solutions. tis particularly suited for welding Carpenter 20 HV9. HV9A Uranus 86 UHB
S04L Sandvik 2RK65 and similar materials which are used for these service conditions.
