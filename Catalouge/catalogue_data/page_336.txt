Characteristics  Applications 
F Cr-Mo 2 (MOD) is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish gives
amooth flaw stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. This wire
having lesser impurities Le. 5 P will improve the subzero impact property. It gives
radiographic quality welds. It is suitable for welding 2.25%Cr-1%1Mo steel. The weld metal
possesses good high temperature properties. Especially suitable for welding of pipes and
tubes of matching composition in Power plants Refineries Petrochemicals EL
plants ete. Suitable for welding of ASTM steels Grade F22 (class 1  3) of 84-182 and 8
