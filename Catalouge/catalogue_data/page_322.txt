Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme-309L is a solid wire for MIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth
flow stable arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality weld deposit. The weld metal has excellent mechanical properties and possesses
good oxidation and sealing resistance at elevated temperatures. It iz ideally suited for
welding stainless steels wrought and cast materials of similar composition welding of
18/8 type stainless steels to carbon steels for buffer layers for welding clad side of 18/8 clad
stainless steels etc
