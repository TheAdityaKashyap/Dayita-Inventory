Characteristics  Applications 
A stainless steel electrode depositing an 18%Cr-12%Ni-2.5Mo stainless steel weld metal
with high carbon up to 0.08% Provides higher tensile and creep strengths at elevated
temperatures Good crack resistance and resistance to scaling up to 860C Joining AISI
316H and its equivalent materials in a number of industries like rayon dve paper
chemical fertilizer petrochemicals etc. Surfacing and overlay applications.
