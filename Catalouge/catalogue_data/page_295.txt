Characteristics  Applications 
DH 1250 is a basic coated electrode depositing monel weld metal. Ideal for welding of
monel to monel Ni-Cu alloys to themselves Ni-Cu alloy to steels for welding clad side of
Ni-Cu clad steel and for surfacing on steel parts for service st corrosion by sea water
chlorinated solvents sulphuric acid and alkalies ideal for marine chemical food dairy
and oil refining industries.
