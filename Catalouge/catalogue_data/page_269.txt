Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
CCR-20 is a special type hardfacing electrode depositing chromium carbide mich weld
metal. The electrode operates on AC / DC(). The weld metal has excellent resistance to
severe abrasion with mild impact Ideally suited for a wide range of hardfacing
applications to enhance resistance to severe abrasion erosion and oxidation. Typical
applications include coal crushing hammers plough shares drag line bucket lips tractor
prousers cane knives rolling mill guides ete.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dev. Re-dry the electrodes at 200-250C for  hour.
2 Do not deposit. more than two layers of CCR-20 In case a heavy build-up is required use buffer
layers with Indotherme electrodes and then continue the build-up for two more layers.
