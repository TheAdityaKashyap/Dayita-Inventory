Characteristics  Applications 
Maxflux SAF- is an agglomerated fluoride-basic type flux suitable to weld with
Autotherme Grade-H (ENi-2)  Autotherme Grade H(C) (2CNi2) wires for medium to
high tensile strength steel fine grained structural steels where very low diffusible
hydrogen content good crack resistance and higher sub zere toughness properties are
desired from the weld metal. The weld deposit with these wires  flux is of radiographic
quality.Maxflux SAF-9 is suitable for single and multi-layer welding of high strength
quench  tempered steel ASTM 516 Gr.70 or Equivalent grade of steels fine grained 
heat resistance structural steels nuclear sector fabrication etc.
