Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-12RJ is anall-position mild steel flux cored wire designed for optimum performance
and excellent impact properties when using 100%CO ArCO gas shielding. The wire is
characterized with smooth metal transfer uniform welding even on vertical-wp stringer
beads and easy slag removal. Filler contour is fat to slightly convex with equal leg lengths
and uniform sidewall wetting. Weld metal is of radiographic quality and contains
extremely low diffusible hydrogen (4ml per 100gms).
Maxfil-12RJ is designed for single and multi-pass welding of low and medium carbon steels
like SA-36 AVAICD grades of SA-283 AJAVC grades of SA-285 AB prades of SA-414 etc
The wire is suitable for structural fabrication ship building converter vessels rotary kiln
shells heavy duty structures  tanks boilers dredgers etc
