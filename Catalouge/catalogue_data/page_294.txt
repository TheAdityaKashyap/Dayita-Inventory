Characteristics  Applications 
DH 1283(N8) is a non-synthetiec electrode for welding similar and dissimilar alloys like
mild steel stainless steel  nickel base alloys. Weld metal has good pitting and crevice
corrosion resistance t resists scaling up to 1100C Ideal for welding low carbon Ni-Cr-Mo
alloys clad side of joints in steel clad with low carbon Ni-Cr- Mo alloys and for welding low
carbon Ni- Cr- Mo alloy to steel and to other nickel base alloys.
