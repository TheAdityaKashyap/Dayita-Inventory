 AWSSFA5.23  F8P2-EA4-A4 
Characteristics  Applications 
Mergeare SAF- 723 is an agelomerated flux to weld both medium  high tensile stre bey
structural steels. The flux works at reasonably higher welding speed giving smooth bead
and easy slag removal characteristics. The flux is also suitable for multi-wire SAW
applications with good CVN toughness The weld metal gives very less diffusible hydrogen
(5 ml/100gms of weld metal) and radiographic quality deposits. Mergearc SAF-723 flux is
suitable for single  multilayer welding of various structural pressure vessels  other
medium to high tensile strength steels. Especially suitablefor welding of ASTM class
steels A204 Grade A A516 Gr BC  1S 2002type B API Gr 5L X60-X 80 ete
