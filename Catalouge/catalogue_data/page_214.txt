AWS SFA 5.4
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 347-17 is an electrode depositing 19%Cr-10.Ni-Nb stabilized weld metal suitable
for joining of stainless steels of similar composition. It works well with transformer and
good re-striking characteristic. Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability
characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled
weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within
current range specified and no porosity. Ideal for welding of AIST 304 3041 321 347 and
their equivalents.The weld metal has excellent resistance tointergranular corrosion.
