Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-i(MOD) is a basie coated. low hydrogen type electrode depositing a weld
metal with 6%Cr-0.5%Mo ideally suited for welding of creep resisting steels of similar
composition where superior notch toughness required at sub-zero temperatures. The weld
metal possesses excellent creep properties up to 550C. Typical applications include
welding of 6%0Gr-0.68Mo0 steels in oil refinery chemical plant and equipments.
Specifically applicable wherever prolonged heat treatments are involved.
