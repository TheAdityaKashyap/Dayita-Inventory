Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  E9018-G
Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen electrode deposits 9%Cr-1%Mo and enriched with Niobium Vanadium
Nitrogen and tungsten Tungsten additions provides adequate creep rupture strength at
higher steam pressures and temperatures. The controlled addition of alloying elements
improves the toughness and weldability It is designed to weld advanced materials which
are being used to improve thermal efficiency in power plant refineries ete. Ideal for
welding steels of similar composition to achieve adequate creep rupture strength. Some
typical materials where this electrode can be used are P52 Rotor Steel E911 steels GX12
Cr Mo WY Nb W1 Tete.
