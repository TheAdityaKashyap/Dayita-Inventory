DH-3U Der
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
DH-3U is a specially designed electrode for welding US steel. The weld metal has
excellent crack resistance and has good sealing resistance. It produce quiet and stable are
which is easy to strike and re-strike Detachability of slag is very easy The weld metal is of
radiographic quality. Ideal for joining ferritic to austenitic steels armour plates
austenitic manganese steels dissimilar materials ete.
