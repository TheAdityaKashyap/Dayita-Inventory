Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
A specially developed AC or DC() electrode to produce extra high performance weld
metal. Superior operating characteristics. Deposit sound weld metal reaching maximum
hardness as deposited Weld metal highly resistant to heat corrosion and wear with the
shock resistance necessary for forging dies. Ideal for reclamation of forging die hot
working tools impressions reducers guides-ways flat dies ete. Also excellent for a tough
build-up when a higher hardness material is required on the surface.

Precautions 
1. Remove all the material by scarfing or grinding.
2. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 1 hour.
3 Usethe preheat required forthe base material.
4. A carefully designed welding procedure with proper preheat peening cleaning interpass
temperature and PWHT will yield the desired results.
