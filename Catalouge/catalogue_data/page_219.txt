Characteristics  Applications 
DH 16/8/2 is a rutile coated stainless steel electrode depositing 15.5%Cr 8.5% Ni 1.9%Mo
atainless steel weld metal. Electrodes provide excellent operating characteristics with
easy slag detachability The lean composition of weld metal minimize the in-service
formation of inter-metallic compound excellent hot ductility properties which offer
freedom from weld or crater cracking even under high-restraint conditions This lean
version weld metal is ideally suited for welding stainless steels euch as types 16-8-2
304H 316H and 347H for high pressure high temperature piping systems and catalytic
cracker structures

Precautions 
1. Re-dry the electrodes at 350C for 2 hours
2. Use short arc stringer bead and smallest size of electrode minimum current to
ensure minimum heat. in pit
