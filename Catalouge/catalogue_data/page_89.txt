ULTRATENSAL-1000 -
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Ultratensal-1000 is a basic coated electrode. The weld metal displays good crack
resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing excellent strength combined with
good impact properties at sub-zero temperature Welds are of radiographic quality. It is
suitable for joining high strength low alloy or micro alloyed steels to themselves or ta
lower strength steels including carbon steels. Ideally euited for welding earth moving
equipments and other heavy equipments.
