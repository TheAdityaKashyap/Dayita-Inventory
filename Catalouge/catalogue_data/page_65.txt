Characteristics  Applications 
Medio- is a medium coated rutile type all position electrode. The electrode operates on
alternating and direct current either polarity. The weld metal is soft ductile
metallurgically clean and mechanically sound with radiographic quality. Typical
applieations include industrial papes and tubes storage tanks bowlers fire boxes tanks
ships barges dredgers trawlers tugs rail coaches etc.
