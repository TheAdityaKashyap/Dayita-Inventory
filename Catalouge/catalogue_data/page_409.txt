Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-801(25 is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of medium  high
tensile strength steel quenched  tempered steels etc where sub-zero impact resistance
property of the weld metal is desired. The wire produces optimum performance and
radiographic quality weld deposits under CO shielding. The weld has excellent bead
appearance and easy slag removal.Maxfil-80LG6 is designed for single and multi-pass
welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels like NAXTRA-60/66
Sumiten-610 A/B grades of SA-204 DV EY F/G grades of SA-414 steel grades conforming to
5A-455 Gr 60  Gr.65 steels of SA-515  SA-516 etc.
