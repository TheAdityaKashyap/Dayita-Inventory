AWS SFA 5.5  12018M
EN ISO 18275-B E 83 18 N4C2M2 A H5
Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated electrode with a stable and smooth are easy to strike and restrike.
Low spatter and good bead finish. Welds are of radiographic quality. The weld metal
displays good crack resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing excellent
strength combined with good impact properties at subzero temperature It 1s suitable for
joining many high strength low alloy or micro alloyed steels to themselves or to lower
strength steels including carbon steels. Ideally suited for welding earth moving
equipments and other heavy equipments.
