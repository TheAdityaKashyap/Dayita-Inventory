Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated electrode yielding an extra low carbon 24%Cr-12%Ni weld metal The weld
metal has excellent mechanical properties and possesses goad oxidation and scaling
resistance at elevated temperatures Ideally suited for welding stainless steels wrought
and cast materials of similar composition welding of 18/8 type stainless steels to carbon
steels for buffer layers for welding clad side of 18/4 clad stainless steels etc.
