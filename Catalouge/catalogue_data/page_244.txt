Codification 
AWS SPA 5.4  E410NiMo-15
Characteristics  Applications 
A basic coated high purity electrode yielding a controlled carbon 12%Cr-4%Ni- 0.5%Mo
stainless steel weld metal for welding ASTM CA 6 NM castings or similar materials Rasy
to operate in all conventional positions Gives minimum spatter. Weld metal possesses
excellent resistance to corrosion pitting abrasion and impact. Ideally suited for surfacing
castings of similar composition subjected to wear by corrosion erosion abrasion combined
with impact. Typical applications include For welding of cuide vanes and runners
hardfacing of valve seats turbine blades in hydro power plants pulp and paper
machinery rebuilding of gas steam turbines etc.
