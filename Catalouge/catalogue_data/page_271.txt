Characteristics  Applications 
CCR(SPL) is a semi-basic super heavy coated hardfacing electrode producing a high
carbon high chromium and nickel alloy weld deposit. The weld metal is extremely hard at
room temperature and retains tte hardness up to 450C The weld metal has excellent
resistance to high temperature abrasion. Typical applications include hardfacing of blast
furnace bells hoppers parts in coke chutes coal handling equipments etc.
