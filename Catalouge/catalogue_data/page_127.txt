Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
Alow hydrogen and low carbon type electrode depositing 6.6% Ni steel weld metal. Ideal
for welding fine grained and Nickel steels for service temperatures down to -115C.
Typical applications include pressure vessels piping valves and tanks used for storage
transportation and distribution of liquefied gases. Alao suitable for welding heavy sections
and highly restrained joints subjected to dynamic loading impact and severe service
conditions.
