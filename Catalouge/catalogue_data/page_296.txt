Characteristics  Applications 
DH 1260 is a nickel base electrode. t gives soft and smooth arc which is easy to strike
and re-strike. tis easy to operate in AC also. The weld metal is of radiographic quality and
displays a good combination of strength and impact strength even at -196C Electrodes of
sizes wp to 4.14 mm dia metal can be used for welding in all positions It is recommended to
use other sizes in horizontal and flat positions for achieving better results. Ideal for
welding 9% Nickel eteel for cryogenic storage tanks for LNG and other similar alloys as
well as the clad side of joints in steel clad with a NiCr-Mo alloy and for welding Ni-Cr-Mo
alloys tosteel and toother nickel base alloys.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 500-350C for 1 hour.
2. Operate the electrodes wherever possible weld in flat position only
3. Maintain a short are use stringer bead and minimize the heat input.
