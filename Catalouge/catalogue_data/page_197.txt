Characteristics  Applications 
DH 309LMo is a stainless steel electrode yielding a weld deposit of low carbon 25%Cr-
12% .Ni-2.5%Mo which has good oxidation resistance up to 1050C t is ideally suited for
welding wrought and cast stainless steel of similar composition for overlay applications to
resist heat and corrosion overlays on ferritic steels buffer lavers for joining dissimilar
steels such as 18-11-Mosteel to mild steel etc.
