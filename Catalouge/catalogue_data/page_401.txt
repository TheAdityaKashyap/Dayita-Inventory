Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-71W designed for single and multi pass welding on Weathering Corten Weathering
Al steels. The wire burns with smooth arc and low spatter. Weld metal contains extremely
low diffusible hydrogen (4ml per LO0gm). The wire gives optimum performance with
100%CO shielding and characterized with smooth metal transfer uniform welding even
on vertical-up stringer beads and easy slag removal.The weld metal mechanical properties
afford a high degree of security against heavy stress and for welds on thick plates. The weld
deposit has excellent atmospheric corrosion resistance.
