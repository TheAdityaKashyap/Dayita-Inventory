Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-12 is a lime-fluoride type electrode yielding a deposit containing 11%Cr -
O.5%oNi -Li0%Mo -0.0% -0.5%W. The weld metal has excellent creep and oxidation
resistant properties up to TOOC. The electrode is used for welding creep resistant 12%Cr
steels in turbines steam boilers and chemical plant where operating temperatures of the
order of 600C are encountered. Following are some of the creep-resiatant steels that can
he welded.
