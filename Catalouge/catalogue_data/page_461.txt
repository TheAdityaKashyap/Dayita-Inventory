 AUTOTHERME GRADE-1223 222EX
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme Grade-1223 is a solid wire that gives smooth flow stable are and spatter free
welding under optimum conditions. It gives radiographic quality welds. Ideal for welding
Ni-Cr-Mo alloys to them selves and to steel and for surfacing steel. The wires are used in
applications where the temperature ranges from cryogenic to 540C. t also can be used for
welding Ni base alloys to steel deal for valves valve seats impellers guide points
bushing bearings journals hot working tools like hot shear blades forging dies
trimming dies piercing punches etc Also used for weld repair of various iron base alloys
and diseimilar joint of Nickel Cobalt and iron bage alloys
