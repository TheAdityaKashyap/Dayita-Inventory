Characteristics  Applications 
DH 1414(N8) provide excellent operating characteristics for groove and fillet welding in
down hand position and smaller diameter electrodes are suitable for all position welding.
Weld metal gives good resistance to the corrosion resistance to reducing oxidizing crevice
and pitting corrosion. It is suitable to join duplex super duplex and super austenitic
stainless steels and ideally suitable for nickel alloys auch as Inconel alloy C-276 622 625
686 UNS NOGOS9 and NOGO22. Typical applications are include chemical process
petrochemical oil and gas marine industries ete.
