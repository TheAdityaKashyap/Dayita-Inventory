Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-701(25 is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of medium  high
tensile strength steel quenched  tempered steels etc. where sub-zero impact resistance
property of the weld metal is desired The weld metal is designed for thick plates so that
properties are maintained after stress relief heat treatment also. The wire is results
optimum performance and radiographic quality weld deposits under C hielding. The
weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal Maxfil-701G4 1s designed for
single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels
like NAXTRA-60/65 Sumiten-610 A/B grades of 84-203 D/ E/ FG grades of SA-414 steel
grades conforming to SA-455 Gr.60  Gr.G4 steels of 84-515  SA-516 ete. Based on the
composition  plate thickness preheating  inter-pass temperature shall be maintained.
