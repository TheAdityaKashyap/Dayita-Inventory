Characteristics  Applications 
DH 307-17 is a special electrode depositing a stainless steel weld metal which possess
high crack resistant with moderate strength It works well with transformer and good re-
striking characteristic. Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability
characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled
weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within
current range specified and no porosity. It is ideally suited for moderate strength welds
with good crack resistance between dissimilar steels such as austenitic manganese steel
and carbon steel forgings or castings

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 800C for 2 hours.
2. Use low current short arcand minimum weaving.
