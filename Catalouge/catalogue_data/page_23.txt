OUR PROFILE
DH 2594 (NS) Non-synthetic electrode depositing
super duplex stainless steel weld metal. The weld
metal exhibit. high strength high impact energy and
resistance to stress corrosion cracking pitting and
crevice corrosion.
DH 1223 (NS) A non-synthetic electrode depositing
homogeneous Ni-Cr-Mo alloy composition Ideal for
welding Ni-Cr-Mo alloys to themselves and to steel
and for surfacing. The electrodes are used in
applications where the temperature ranges from
cryogenic to 540C.
DH 1400(Mod) Non-synthetic electrode for joining
repair and surfacing to resist abrasion corrosion
oxidation and high temperature service. Weld metal
containing low carbon Cr-Mo-W- Co. Excellent
resistance to heat strength and toughness up to
LoOoeC.
Cromotherme-23 Low hydrogen iron powder
electrode depositing 2.2%Cr-0.5%Ni-0.2%0Mo-1.5W-
0.2V Weld metal of having less impurities ie. 5 P
will improve the impact property at subzero
temperatures. Ideal for welding P23 material
welding
DH 2595 (NS) Non-synthetic electrode depositing
super duplex stainless stecl weld metal with
PREN40. The weld metal exhibits high strength
high impact energy and resistance to stress corrosion
cracking pitting and crevice corrosion.
Indotherme Spl (Mod) A basic coated hydrogen
controlled electrode. We metal possesses excellent
crack resistance toughness and excellent resistance
to SSCC and HIC. It is suitable for mild steel and
medium high tensile steels.
Rutox-A (MN) A stainless steel electrode depositing
22Cr-10Ni-0.15N weld metal. The weld metal has
higher resistance to cracking oxidation and scaling at
