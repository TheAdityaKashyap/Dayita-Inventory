Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfill-37B is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high strength fine
grained quenched  tempered steels to meet sub-zero impact resistance property down to -
61C. The wire gives optimum performance under CO shielding and deposits radiographic
quality weld metal. The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal. Maxfil
7B is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and
equivalent grade steels like A/B grades of BA-203 A/BIC grades of SA-662 BC grades of
SA-737 N-A-XTRA-60/65 etc. This wire is used for heavy fabrication work subjected to
dynamic loading earth moving equipments off-shore platforms and similar kind of
applications ete.
