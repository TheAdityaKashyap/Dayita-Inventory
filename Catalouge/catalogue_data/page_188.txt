DH 309H Der
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SFA 54 ES09H-16
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 309H electrode is produces high crack resistant weld metal having good resistance to
corrosion high strength stainless steel weld metal having good oxidation resistance up to
L100C tis ideally suited for welding similar alloys in wrought or cast form. It can also
used for welding dissimilar metals such as joining 533041 to carbon steel welding the
clad side of S8304H clad steels and applying stainless steel sheet lining to carbon steel
shells.
