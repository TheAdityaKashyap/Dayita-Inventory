Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-S8R is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of moderate strength
fine-crained steels to meet sub-zero impact resistance property down to -L8C. The wire is
suitable for positional welding application results easy slag removal and has excellent
welders appeal. Weld bead is smooth  uniform and satisfies the requirements of
radiographie quality. Maxfil-38R is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar
composition steels and equivalent prade steels like A/B grades of SA-203 A/BAIC grades of
SA-662 etc This wire is used for fabrication of penstock pipelines pressure vessels 
valves refineries off-shore structures and similar applications ete.
