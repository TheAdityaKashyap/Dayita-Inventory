Characteristics  Applications 
Rutox-G is a special purpose stainless steel electrode. It is most often used to weld AISI
Type 240 and 241 base metals. These alloys are nitrogen-strengthened sustenitic
stainless steels exhibiting high strength with good toughness over a wide range of
temperatures. Significant improvement in resistance to wear in particle-to metal and
meétal-to-metal (galling) applications. Nitrogen alloying reduces the tendency for
intergranular carbide precipitation in the weld area by inhibiting carbon diffusion and
thereby increasing resistance to intergranular corrosion. Nitrogen alloying also improves
resistance to pitting and creviee corrosion in aqueous chloridecontaining media. t exhibit
improved resistance to transgranular stress corrosion cracking in hot aqueous chloride
containing media. It is also suitable for welding dissimilar steels like mild steel and
stainless steels and also suitable for overlay on mild steel for corrosion and wear
