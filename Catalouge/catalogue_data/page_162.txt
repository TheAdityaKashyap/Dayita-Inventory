Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-23 is a basic coated low hydrogen type electrode depositing a weld metal of
having less impurities 1.6.5 P will improve the impact property at subzero temperatures.
tis ideally suited for swaldinig of creep resisting steels of similar composition. The weld
deposit has excellent creep resistance at service temperatures up to 550C. Typical
applications include welding of P23 steels wherever prolonged heat treatment cycles are
involved
