Maxflux SAF-223 is an apglomerated basic type flux for high-speed longitudinal welding
fiving smooth  shiny weld bead along with easy slag removal characteristics. The flux is
also suitable for multi-wire submerged are welding applications and supports to achieve
higher throat thickness in welding of fillet joints dueto higher current carrying capacity.
Maxflux SAF-223 is suitable for single  multi-layer welding of pressure vessel grade
steels (EN 10028-2) X-42 to X-70 grade pipes conforming to API-5L specification etc.
