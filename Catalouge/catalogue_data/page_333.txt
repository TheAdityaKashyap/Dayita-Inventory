Characteristics  Applications 
F Cr-Mo 1 (MOD) is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish gives
amouth flow stable arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions This wire
having lesser impurities ie. S P will improve the subzero impact property. It gives
radiographic quality welds. It is suitable for welding 1.25%%Cr-0.5%Mo steel The weld
métal possesses good high temperature properties. Especially suitable for welding of pipes
 tubes of matching composition in Power plants Refineries Petrochemicals Fertilizer
plants etc. Suitable for welding of ASTM steels Grade F2 F11 F12 class 1  2 of SA-182
