RUTOX-A(N) DEE
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications
Rutox-A(N) is a stainless steel electrode depositing 22%Cr-10%N1-0.15%N weld metal. t
is a special electrode producing stainless steel weld metal which has excellent operational
characteristics The weld metal has higher resistance to cracking oxidation and scaling at
elevated temperatures up to 11L00C It is ideally suited for welding of stainless steels of
similar composition like ASTM 830815 and equivalent. for overlays surfacing and
repairing castings.
