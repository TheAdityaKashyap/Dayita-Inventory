OUR PROFILE
Cromotherme-9H4R It is used for welding similar
composition plates pipes forging and tubes. Typical
applications include welding of A387 Gr.9 plate A335
P9 pipe A217 C12 castings A213 T9 tubes ete.
DH 4130 It is a specially designed electrode to
match the heat treating properties of SAE 4130 and
8630 materials. It is ideally suited for joining and
surfacing of SAE 4130 and 8630 materials. The weld
metal fulfills the NACE MR 01-75 requirements fo 
use on oil field equipment in sour (H.S) ga and oil
environment.
140. 2014 SECHERON 410NM It is a special purpos electrode
depositing 12%Cr-1.2%Ni-0.2%Mo weld metal which
has excellent resistance to corrosion erosion pitting
and impact. It is ideally suited for joining of similar
composition materials groove welding and filling of
GX8CrNi12 grade Steel castings. Typical applications
include process pumps steam valves gas valves
volute casting casing covers pump shaft impellers
etc
DH430NM  Is ai special purpose electrode
depositing 16%Cr-5%Ni-1%Mo weld metal which has
excellent resistance to corrosion erosion pitting and
impact. Typical applications include surfacing of high
pressure valves turbine blades valve seats repairs of
runners pumps-and combustion building pulp and
paper plant equipment etc.
Indotherme(5Spl) H4R is suitable for mild steel and
medium high tensile steels subjected to dynamic
loading high stresses and impact. Weld deposit
displays excellent toughness at sub zero temperatures
down to -46C
Indotherme(Spl)Mod-H4R is basic coated low
hydrogen moisture resistance electrode. Weld metal
has crack resistant and tough weld metal of
radiographic quality It is suitable for mild steel and
medium high tensile steels subjected to dynamic
