OUR PROFILE
loading high stresses and impact. Weld deposit
displays excellent toughness at sub zero temperatures
down to -46C.
Secheron 308Mo electrode display good resistance
to corrosion cracking  sealing. is recommended for
welding ASTM CFS8 stainless steel castings and
welding wrough materials such as type 316 stainless
when increased ferrite is desired.
Ultratensal-69 Is basic coated extra low hydrogen
electrode ideally suited for welding high strength
QT steels like Welten 80 SA517 grades and their
equivalents. The weld metal has excellent crack
resistance and displays high strength combined with
rood sub-zero impact strength. It is ideal for welding
high strength low alloy steels used for sub-marine
hull construction.
DH 1201(NS) Electrodes are used for welding
Nickel-Chromium-Iron alloy for the clad side of joints
in steel clad with steel Nickel-Chromium-Iron alloy
and for surfacing steel with Nickel-Chromium-lron on
weld metal. The electrodes may be used for
applications at temperatures ranging from cryogenic
to around 980C These electrodes are also suitable
for joining steel to Nickel base alloys.
Nitherme-6.5L Is low hydrogen and low carbon type
electrode depositing 6.5% Ni steel weld metal. Ideal
for welding fine grained and Nickel steels for service
temperatures down to -115C. Typical applications
include pressure vessels piping valves and tanks
used for storage transportation and distribution of
liquefied gases. Also suitable for welding heavy
sections and highly restrained joints subjected to
dynamic loading impact and severe service
conditions.
DH NM-CI Is the most economical for repairing
various types of  ast iron where machinability of the
weld deposit is not required where weld shrinkage
