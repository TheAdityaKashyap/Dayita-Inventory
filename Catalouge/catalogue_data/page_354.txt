Characteristics  Applications 
FW 320 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives amooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit. The weld metal provides resistance to intergranular corrosion. Ideally surted to
weld base metal of similar composition for applications where resistance to severe
corrosion involving a wide range of chemicals including sulfuric and sulfurous acids and
their salts is required. It-can be used to weld both castings and wrought allove of similar
composition.
