Characteristics  Applications 
Rutox-F(SPL) is a stainless steel electrode depositing zero ferrite weld metal which
displays excellent resistance to corrosion particularly in urea service. The welds are of
radiographic quality and possess excellent corrosion resistance. Ideally suited for welding
ALSD316L and their equivalents for chemical and fertilizer industries.

Precautions 
Welding should be carned out taking care to avoid build up of heat. It is imperative
that due control is exercised for keeping interpass temperature low and in any case
below 150C
Size of electrode should be smallest practicable
Are should be as short as possible.
Weaving should be minimised.
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour.
