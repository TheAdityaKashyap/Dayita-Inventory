Characteristics  Applications 
Batox-F(UM is a basie coated electrode depositing fully austenitic stainless steel weld
metal The deposit possesses excellent crack resistance and is suitable for welding for high
pressure parts of urea plant equipment to resist severe corrosion t 1s ideally suited for
welding of stainless steels of similar composition and their equivalents for overlays
surfacing applications etc
