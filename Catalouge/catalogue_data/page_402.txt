Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-8OR is an all position low alloy steel flux cored wire designed to deposit
approximately 2.25% Cr-1.0%Mo weld metal. The wire 1s suitable for positional welding
application results easy slag removal and has excellent welders appeal. The weld bead is
smooth  uniform and meets the radiographic requirements. Maxfil-S0R is designed for
single and multi-pass welding of similar composition creep resistant steels and equivalent
erade steels like Gr. F22 of SA-182  and 84-346 Gr. T4/T22 of SA-199 2 of BA-213
Gr WC9 of SA-217 Gr. P22 of SA-335 Gr FP22 of SA-369 Gr 22/221 of SA-387 Gr. CP22
