Compile Welding Support
Common Gas Metal Arc Welding Defects
POSSIBLE CAUSES CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Electrode contamination  Use clean and dry electrodes
 Eliminate contamination of electrode
wire with any lubricant
Work-piece contamination  Remove oil grease rust paints and
dusts from the work surface prior to
welding.
Arc voltage too high  Reduce the operating voltage
Excess nozzle-to-work distance  Reduce electrode extension
INCOMPLETE FUSION
Work-piece surface not clean  Clean all groove surfaces and
weld zones
Insufficient heat input  Increase the electrode feed rate and
the are voltage
 Decrease the travel speed
Too large a weld puddle  Reduce arc weaving
INCOMPLETE FUSION
Improper welding technique  Direct the electrode at the leading
edge of the weld pool
 During weaving hold momentarily on
the groove face
Improper joint design  Select proper groove design
 Maintain a proper groove angle to
provide an easy access to electrode
extension
