Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-410NiMo is stainless steel flux cored wire designed for optimum performance with
LOW6CO gas shielding which deposit 11.5%Cr  4.5%Ni-0.55%Mo. This wire is designed
with fast freezing slag characteristica and good slag detachability. The wire welds
satisfactorily when welding in the flat  horizontal position. Maxfil-410NiMo is designed
for welding CAGNM castings used in hydroclectric turbines or similar applications etc.
