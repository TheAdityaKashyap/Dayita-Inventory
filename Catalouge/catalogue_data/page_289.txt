AWS SPA 5.11  ENiCrMo-3
EN ISO 14172 E Ni 6625
Characteristics  Applications 
Anon-synthetic electrode depositing homogeneous Ni-Cr-Mo alloy composition. It is good
resistance to abrasion oxidation and corrosion tis surtable for welding Ni-CrMoalloys to
themselves and to steel. and for surfacing steel with Ni-Cr-Mo weld metal and ideally
suitable for welding Ni alloy UNS NO6625. The electrodes are use in pressure vessel
fabrication for minus1 96C to 540C otherwise up to the scaling resistance temperature of
1200C (sulphur free atmosphere). Ideal for valves valve seats impellers guide points
bushing bearings journals hot working tools like hot shear blades forging dies trimming
dies piercing punches ete.
