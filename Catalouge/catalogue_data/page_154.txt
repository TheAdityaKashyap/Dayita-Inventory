Characteristics  Applications 
It is low hydrogen electrode producing a weld deposit containing 5%%Cr  0.5%Mo which
has excellent creep resistance at elevated temperatures up to 550C. The weld metal
displays excellent creep resistance with controlled hardness This electrode is used for
welding creep resistant steel and cast steels of similar composition Typical applications
include steam boiler construction welding of steam and super-heater piping power
plants Oil refinery and chemical plants.
