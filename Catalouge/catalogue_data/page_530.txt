if t is thickness of plate or pipe to be joint  is the groove angle. The calculation of weld
metal by SMAWY process is as under Also consider length (L) is 1 meter
We know
Density Mass/Volume
Mass Densily x Volume
To calculate volume Volume Area x Length (In figure there are 3 area)

Consider t 12mm  6  30
b 12x lan 30
12x0.577
BEA (tan 30  0.577)
Now Volume fram Eq. (A)
 2 (2x 6.92 x 12  (2.x 12) x 1000 mm3 
 (83.04  24) x 1000 mm3  consider a  2rnim)
 107043 mm3
 107.43 cm3
Now
Mass  7.85 gm cma x 107.04 cm3 (Density of carbon steel  7.85 gmicm3
40 gm
We know the deposition efficiency of SMAW is 65% (multiple factor will be 1.54)
So
840 x 1.54  1294 gm
For Reinforcement consider 20% Extra
 1294  20%
 1204 x 1.2
 1553 gm
