Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-150 is a semi-basic mild steel flux cored wire designed for all position welding with
1Lo00%%CO shielding. The wire gives smooth burning characteristics. low spatter and easy
slag removal. Filler contour is flat to slightly convex with equal leg lengths and uniform
sidewall wetting. The deposited weld metal is of radiographic quality. Maxfil-15R is
designed for single and multi-pass welding of low and medium carbon steels grades like C
DE grades of SA-414 Gr.55 Gr.60 steels of SA-516 and equivalent grade steels ete.
