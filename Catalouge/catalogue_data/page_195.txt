Characteristics  Applications 
DH 309 Mo is a stainless steel electrode yielding a weld deposit of 25%Cr-12%Ni-
25%.Mo which has good oxidation resistance up to 1060C. Ideally suited for welding 18-
11-Mo type steels to mild steel welding the clad side of 18-11-Mo clad steels overlays on
ferritic steels buffer layers etc
