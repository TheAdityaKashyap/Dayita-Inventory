ULTRATENSAL 2/22
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
Characteristics  Applications  a
ULTRATENSAL electrode is low hydrogen iron powder type electrode for welding high
strength steels. The weld deposits of this electrode have high strength with excellent
toughness. It is ideally suited for welding high tensile steels grain refined QT steels
such as USS-T1 84.517 grades and their equivalents Fabrication of penstocks heavy
structures earth moving equipments ete.
