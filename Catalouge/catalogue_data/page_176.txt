Characteristics  Applications 
Asemi-basic electrode producing an extra low carbon 19%Cr-10Ni weld metal which has
excellent resistance to intergranular corrosion The weld metal has higher resistance to
cracking oxidation and scaling at elevated temperatures Ideally suited for welding of
stainless steels of similar composition lke AIST 304L 308L and their equivalents for
overlays surfacing applications ete.
