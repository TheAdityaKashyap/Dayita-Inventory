CORRECTIVE ACTION
Clean joint area
Store electrodes properly
Follow manufactures recommended
rebaking procedure
Use preheating/warm up work piece.
Use basic coated electrodes
Change welding parameters and
technique
Use preheat
Increase heat input
Clean work surfaces and each weld run
thoroughly. Wherever necessary use
power wire brush grinders chisels to
ensure a thorough removal of slag
Improve welding technique
Reposition work to prevent loss of
slag control wherever possible
Restrict weaving to a minimum
Increase groove angle
