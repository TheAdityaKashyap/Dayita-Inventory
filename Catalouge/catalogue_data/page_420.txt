Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-316L is stainless steel flux cored wire designed for optimum performance with
Lo0%%CO gas shielding. This wire is designed with fast freezing slag characteristics and
food slag detachability. The wire welds satisfactorily in out of position and performs
equally well when welding in the flat  horizontal position. The weld metal is of
radiographic quality and to obtain resistance to intergranular corrosion due to carbon
precipitation without the use of stabilizers. Maxfil-316L is designed for welding of low
carbon similar composition steels like 316L type and their equivalents with excellent weld
ability.
