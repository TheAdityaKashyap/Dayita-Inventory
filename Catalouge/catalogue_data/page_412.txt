Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-120105 is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high tensile
strength steel quenched and tempered steels etc. The weld metal is suitable for
fabrication of dynamically loaded structures and resulta good impact resistant property at
sub-zero temperatures. The wire gives optimum performance under CO shielding with
radiographic quality weld deposits. The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag
removal Maxfil-1201G5 is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar
composition steels fine grained steels and equivalent grade steels like HY-80 Sumiten-
610 C/D Grades of 54-225 BAC Grades of 54-543 steels conforming to SA-612 grade
ABIC grades of SA-748 etc
