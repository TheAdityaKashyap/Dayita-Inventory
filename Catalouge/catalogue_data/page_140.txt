Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  E7018-B2L
Characteristics  Applications 
Low carbon weld metal having lesser impurities Le. 8 P will improve the subzero impact
property and retains its mechanical properties after prolonged heat treatments. Ideal for
welding similar composition materials The weld metal displays excellent creep resistance
with controlled hardness It is specially applicable wherever the impact property
requirement at subzero temperatures up to -20C
