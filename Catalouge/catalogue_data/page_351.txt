Characteristics  Applications 
FW 316 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit. The weld metal has excellent resistance to intergranular corrosion even at
elevated temperatures. It 1s ideal for welding stainless steel of similar composition in
wrought or cast form and for overlay application to resist heat and corrosion. It is suitable
for number of industries like rayon dye paper chemical fertilizer petrochemicals etc.
