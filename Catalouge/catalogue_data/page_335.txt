Characteristics  Applications 
F Cr-Mo 2 is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish. The wire gives
atable arc smooth welding performances and deposits radiographic quality welds. It is
suitable for welding 2.25%Cr-1%Mao steel The weld metal possesses good high
temperature properties Especially suitable for welding of pipes and tubes of matching
composition in Power plants Refineries Petrochemicals Fertilizer plants etc. Suitable
for welding of ASTM steels Grade F22 (class 1  3) of 84-182 and SA-336 Grade T4 T22 of
S4-199 Grade T22 of SA-213 Grade WC9 of SA-217 Grade P22 of SA-335 Grade FP22 of
