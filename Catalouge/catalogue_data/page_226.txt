Characteristics  Applications 
Batox-D is a basic coated stainless steel electrode depositing an extra low carbon 18%Cr-
12%Ni-2.9%Mo stainless steel weld metal. The weld metal has excellent resistance to
intergranular corrosion even at elevated temperatures. Ideally suited for welding
stainless steels of similar composition
