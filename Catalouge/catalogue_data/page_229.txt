AWS SFA 5.4 ) 3161-15
Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated type electrode producing low carbon stainless steel weld which has excellent
to resistance to cracking even on heavy and restrained joints. t has exceptional quality in
meeting stringent applications where sub zero temperatures properties are required
Balance Cr-Ni weld deposits with ferrite contralled below 2 FN ensure excellent resistance
to the weld metal from formation of sigma phase corrosion oxidation and pitting at
elevated temperatures. It is suitable for welding of ATS 316 and 316L particularly when
the ferrite in the weld deposit has to be controlled at a low level as in the case of equipment
for urea plant. The presence of Molybdenum enhances the corrosion resistance of the weld
metal in reducing media as in urea service
