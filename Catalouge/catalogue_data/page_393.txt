Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-41R is an all position low alloy steel flux cored wire designed to deposit
approximately 2.25%Cr-1.0%Mo weld metal. The wire is suitable for positional welding
application results casy slag removal and has excellent welders appeal. The weld bead is
smooth  uniform and meets the radiographic requirements. Maxfil-41R is designed for
single and multi-pass welding of similar composition creep resistant steels  nd equivalent
grade steels like Gr. F22 of SA-182  and SA4-336 Gr. T4/T22 of 8A-199 Gr. T22 of SA- 218
