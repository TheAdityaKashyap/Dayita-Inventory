CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
LACK OF PENETRATION
Improper joint preparation
Improper welding technique
 Provide/Increase root openings in
butt-joint
 Decrease the height of root face
 Adequate access to maintain proper
nozzle-to-work distance
 Maintain the arc on the leading edge
of the weld pool
 Select proper travel angle to achieve
maximum penetration
Improper welding technique
 Increase electrode feed rate
Maintain proper nozzle-to-work
 distance
EXCESSIVE MELT THROUGH
Excessive heat input
