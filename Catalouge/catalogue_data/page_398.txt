Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-65H is a basic type medium alloy gas shielded wire designed for air hardening type
hard surfacing deposit. It has good welders appeal  oasy slag detachability. The weld is
not machinable and finished by grinding. The wire deposits a erack-free martensitic weld
metal suitable for heavy impact and moderate abrasion resistant applications Maxfil-45H
wire is suitable for weld-surfacing  reclamation of agricultural equipments forging dies
excavator components conveyor buckets  screws drill bits scraper blades conveyor
parts dredge rollers concrete mixer blades etc.
