Characteristics  Applications 
Ultratensal-1050 is a baste coated and very low hydrogen electrode producing high
strength weld metals. The weld metal displays good crack resistance and produces sound
weld metal possessing excellent strength combined with good impact properties at sub-
zero temperature. Welds are of radiographic quality. It ia suitable for joining high
strength low alloy or micro alloved steels to themselves or to lower strength steels
including carbon steels. Ideally suited for welding earth moving equipments and other
heavy equipments.
