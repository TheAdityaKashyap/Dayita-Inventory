Characteristics  Applications 
Copper coated solid wire for submerged are welding. These wires are suitable for welding
of similar composition where impact properties required at subzero temperature downto -
20C. Autotherme Grade-Y low alloy solid wire is suitable for welding of high strength low
alloy or micro alloyed structural steels where a combination of strength and good notch
toughness is required. The weld metal possesses high tensile strength and meets the
radiographic quality requirements. Especially suitable for welding of matching
composition inpower planta Refineries Petrochemicals and Fertilizer Plants. Suitable for
welding of ASTM steels Grade ASTMA516Gr.606570  A537 Clase 1 or 2 ete.
