Re-Drying Conditions
Re-drying temperatures and holding times are specified on the label and in the product
specification. The re-drying temperature is the temperature in the bulk of the electrodes. The
re-drying time is measured from the point at which the re-drying temperature has been
reached. Do not stack more than one layers of electrodes in the re-drying oven. It is
recommended notto re-dry covered electrodes more than five times.
Holding Oven
The holding oven is used for interrnediate storage to avoid moisture pick-up in the coating of
low-hydrogen electrodes and acid rutile stainless ectrodes The electrodes which should be
stored in the holding oven are
1. Electrodes that have been re-dried
2. Electrodes that have been removed from their container
Holding oven temperature 120C-150C.
Handling VacPac Electrodes
Protect VacPac from darnage at all times. The outer board packaging offers extra protection
from damage to the Protective layer. Handle the single inner Protective layer VacPac with
special care. Do notuse a knife or any other sharp object to open the outer board packaging.
Before Using VacPac Electrodes
Check if the protective layer still contains a vacuum. If the vacuum has been last re-dry the
electrodes before use. Cut open the protective layer atone end
Approval
Approval given in this catalague many DH Secheron electrodes are approved by various
authorities railway boards private companies and so on. Information about the difterent
types of approval can be available on request.
Welding Current
Maximum and minimum values are given in product label. The most suitable welding current
depends largely onthe size of the workpiece the welding position and the type of joint.
Marking
The electrode brand name type is clearly marked on the coating of each electrode near the
grip end.
