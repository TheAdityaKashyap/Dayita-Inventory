Characteristics  Applications 
Maxflux 58-4 (LT) is a fluoride basic agglomerated type flux suitable for welding of
austenitic stainless steel and heat resistant steels The flux behavior to carbon content of
Secheron
Compile Welding Support
the weld metal is neutral So using suitable wire low carbon stainless steels can easily be
welded The flux offers good slag detachability amooth weld finish and lesathan 6ml
diffusible hydrogen per 100 gm of weld metal. Maxflux SS-4 flux (LT) can be used with
various low carbon stainless steel wires for joining  for overlay applications. Weld metal
meet impact toughness at -196C requirements. The flux is also suitable to weld with
various Cr-Mo steels  stabilized grade stainless steels.
