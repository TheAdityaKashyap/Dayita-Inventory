Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme-308L is a solid wire for GMAW process available in bright finish gives
smooth flow stable arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives
radiographic quality welds. Wire contains low carbon 20%Cr - 10%Ni. The weld metal
exhibits excellent resistance to Intergranular Corrosion It is ideally suited for welding of
stainless steels of similar composition like J04L and equivalents for overlayve surfacing
and repairing castings of similar materials
