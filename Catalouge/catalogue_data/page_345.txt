Characteristics  Applications 
F 1008-G is a copper-coated solid wire available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
are spatter free under optimum welding conditions. The weld metal displays excellent
crack resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing excellent strength combined
with good impact properties It gives radiographic quality welds It is ideally suited for
welding of high strength QT steels like WEL-TENSO SA 417 SA3d4 P36 grades WE36
pipes and their equivalent grades.
