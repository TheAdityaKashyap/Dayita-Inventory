Characteristics  Applications 
Copper Coated with high manganese contents solid wire for submerged are welding. These
are suitablefor welding of structural steels fine grain steels. Autotherme Grade-E (Mod)
solid wire is suitable for welding of low alloys structural steels. The weld metal possesses
high tensile strength and meets the radiographic quality requirements. Especially
suitable for welding of structural steels pressure vessels and other fabrication steels.
