Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
CCR-200 is a semi-basic super heavy coated hardfacing electrode produce a high carbon
high chromium alloy weld deposit. The deposit resists corrosion and oxidation even at
elevated temperature. The weld metal has excellent resistance to high temperature
abrasion. Typical applications include hardfacing of blast furnace bells hoppers mixer
blades coal handling equipments. coal mill exhauster fan blades excavator blades
acrapers carth moving parts crushing mills screw convevors ash handling pipes atc.
