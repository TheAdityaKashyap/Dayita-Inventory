Characteristics  Applications
Maxflux 8-4 is a fluoride basic agglomerated type flux suitable for welding of austenitic
AWS SPA 3.39
stainless steel and heat resistant steels. The flux behavior to carbon content of the weld
metal is neutral So using suitable wire low carbon stainless steels can easily be welded. The
flux offers good slag detachability smooth weld finish and lessthan 5ml diffusible hydrogen
per 100 gm of weld metal Maxflux 88-4 flux can be used with various stainless steel wires for
joining  for overlay applications. The flux is also suitable with various Cr- Mo steels
stabilized grade stainless steel. With AISI 450 wire the weld metal result 30-40 HRC.
