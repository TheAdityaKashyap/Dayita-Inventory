Characteristics  Applications 
Nimotherme-1(SPL)H4RK is a low hydrogen iron powder moisture resistance electrade
yielding a tough and ductile weld deposit having liNr - 0.25%Mo. Ideally surted for
welding fine-grained and nickel steels for service temperatures down to -40C. Typical
applications include storage tanks for liquefied gases like Ammonia distillers in coke oven
batteries and petrochemical industries. Also suitable for welding heavy sections and
highly restrained joints subjected to dynamic loading. impact and severe service
conditions.
