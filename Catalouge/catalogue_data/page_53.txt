Characteristics  Applications 
Cellutherme-AC is a light coated cellulosic type. ideally suited for welding in all positions
including vertices downwards. The electrode is characterized by forceful spray type arc
which is also stable and easy to strike and re-strike The weld beads are evenly rippled.
Extremely beneficial for welding of pipes in Stove Pipe Technique both for faster welding
and greater control on penetration of the root runs The welds are of radiographic quality.
It is designed for welding pipes and tubes of all diameters in Stove Pipe Technique
specially for root runs for achieving good penetration. Typical applications include
Storage tanks Pressure vessels Tank wagons Tipping wagons Rail coaches Automobile
body and panels Chutes Silos Chimneys Ducts Ships hull construction etc
