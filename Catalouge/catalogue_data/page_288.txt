Characteristics  Applications 
Non- synthetic electrode depositing Ni-Cr-Fe weld metal which is very good resistance to
SCC and IGC due to low carbon content and absence of sigma phase. Control boron and
zirconium are helpful in reducing the tendency for ductility dip cracking. It has scaling
temperature up to 1100C in air. It is ideally suited for welding the Ni-Cr-Fe alloy of the
UNS number NOG69O It is also use for the welding of Ni-Cr-Fe alloys to steels and
stainless atecls and for corrosion resistant overlays on steels. Typical specifications for Ni-
Cr-Fe base metals are ASTM B166 BL67 and B168. Ideal for stringent requirements in the
construction of nuclear reactors

Precautions
1. Ensurethe electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 300-325C for 1 hour
Maintain a short are stringer bead and minimize the heat input
For dissimilar metal welding control the dilution by
a. Operating at lower currents
b. Using stringer beads and faster welding speeds.
