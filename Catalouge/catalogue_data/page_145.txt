Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen iron powder electrode depositing 2.25%Cr -11Mo weld metal having low
level of impurities and exhibiting excellent toughness up to -18C. Weld metal retains its
mechanical properties even after prolonged heat treatments. Ideal for welding steels of
similar composition to achieve tough weld metals
