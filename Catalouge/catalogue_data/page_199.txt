Characteristics  Applications 
DH 310-16 is a 25%Cr - 20% Ni type electrode for welding steels of simular composition.
The weld metal has excellent resistance to oxidation and scaling up to 1200C. The
electrode is also suitable for welding of hardenable steels clad steels C-Mo Cr-Mo steels
where pre-heat and post weld heat treatment are not feasible
