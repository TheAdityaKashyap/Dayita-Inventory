Characteristics  Applications 
FW 410NiMo is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow
stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality weld deposit Weld metal possesses excellent resistance to corrosion pitting
abrasion and impact. Welding for surfacing of ASTM CA 6 NM castings and similar
composition subjected to wear by corrosion erosion abrasion combined with impact.
Ideally suitable for welding of guide vanes and runners hard facing of valve seats turbine
blades in hydro power plants pulp and paper machinery rebuilding of gas steam turbines
