Compile Welding Support
Maxfil-36B2 is a low alloy steel flux cored wire des 2d for welding of creep resisting
steels like O.5vCr-().5%Mo 10Or-t Mo ete. for high temperature
and pressure service conditions in At pipes see boilers The wire gives optimum
performance under CO shielding with radiographic quality weld deposits. The wire
produces thin  friable slag covering with shiny bead appearance Maxfil-8682 is
designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and equivalent
grade steels like Gr F2/F11/F12 of SA-182 Gr T11 of SA-199 Gr. T2/T11/T12 of SA-213
Gr. WC6 of SA-217 Gr P2/P11/P 12 of SA-335 Gr. FP2/FPLLUFPI12 of 84-369 Gr. 2/11/12
of SA-387 Gr CP2ICP11/CP12 of SA-426 etc.
