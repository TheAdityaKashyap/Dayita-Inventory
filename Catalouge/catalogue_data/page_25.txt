Complete Welding Support
OUR PROFILE
like Ammonia distillers in coke oven batteries and
petrochemical industries Also suitable for welding
heavy sections and highly restrained joints subjected
to dynamic loading impact and severe service
conditions.
Complete range of Tubular hard facing electrodes
launched.
Cromotherme-2 (RTE) Special electrode to meet
temper embrittlement requirements. Weld metal
having strict control on 5PAs.8n  Sb will improve
the subzero impact properly and resists temper
embrittlement Ideal for welding steam generating
equipments and reactor vessels.
Cromotherme-24 The electrode is used for welding
similar composition materials and SA-182 F22V SA-
336 F22V 8) SA-541 22V Specially applicable
wherever prolonged heat treatments are involved
together with the impact property requirement at
subzero temperature up to -18C. Basically it is used
for fabricating desulphurization reactors heavy
section pressure vessels having similar composition.
Rutox-AH(Cu) Joining and surfacing of 18%%Cr-
8%0Ni stainless steel and clad steels of similar
composition materials i.e. 18Cr-8%Ni cast steel
forged steel etc Cladding carbon steel and low alloy
steel Steels conforming to AIS 304H and their
equivalents can be welded. The composition designed
to withstand high temperature and pressures in
super critical  ultra super critical boilers.
Rutox-AN(St) Special electrode producing 19%Cr-
LO%Ni-Cb stabilized weld metal with N. Joining and
surfacing of 18%Cr-S%Ni stainless steel and clad
steels of similar composition materials i.e. 18%Cr-
8%Ni cast steel forged steel ete. Cladding carbon
steel and low alloy steel. Steels conforming to AISI
304 321 347 and their equivalents can be welded.
The composition designed to withstand high
temperature and pressure in SC  USC boilers.
