Characteristics  Applications  d
Maxflux SAF-4 (UV) is an agglomerated fluoride basic flux suitable to weld medium to high
strength steele  low alloy steels. The weld made with this flux gives very low diffusible
hydrogen content good erack resistance and high sub-zero toughness properties. The flux
provides uniform fusion in fillet welds  butt welds with excellent slag detachability The flux
can be used for multi-pass welding. The wdeposits are of radiographic quality and have less
than 4ml diffusible hydrogen 100gms of weld metal. Maxflux SAF-4 (UV) is suitablefor single
 multilayer welding of various structural Boiler Pressure vessel steels Petrochemical
industries Refineries Shipping Quenched  tempered steel heat resistant steels Nuclear
sector fabrications  otherfabrication industries.
