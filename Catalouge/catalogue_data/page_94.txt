Characteristics  Applications 
Ultratensal-MC is a basic coated extra low hydrogen electrode. Weld metal displays
excellent crack resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing excellent strength
combined with good impact properties at sub zero temperature. It is ideally suited for
welding high strength QT steels hike WEL-TEN 80 WEL-TEN 690 RE-A WEL TEN 690
RE-B RDE-S-70 SA .517 grades and their equivalents. The electrodes are ideally suited
for welding highly restrained joints in high strength steels under site conditions with high
relative humidity since the extra low hydrogen content of the weld metal helps preventing
hydrogen induced cracking
