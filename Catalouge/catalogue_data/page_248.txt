Characteristics  Applications 
DH 25/4 is stainless steel electrode for high temperature applications. Weld metal has
excellent performance in high temperature up to 1100C and defend against attack of
sulphurous oxidizing or reducing combustion gases Ideally suitable for joining and
surfacing on heat-resistant chromium and chromium-nickel steel and cast steel of similar
compositions
