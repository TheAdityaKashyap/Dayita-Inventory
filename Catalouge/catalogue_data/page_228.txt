Characteristics  Applications 
Rutox-F is a stainless steel electrode depositing a weld metal contaming 18%Cr-18%Ni-
2.8% Mo which is unique in combination to produce a maximum ferrite content of 2FN in
the weld metal. This extra low ferrite content ensures excellent corrosion resistance
against severe corrosive media Ideal for welding AISI 316L 316 particularly when the
weld metal ferrite content has to be controlled at a low level as in the case of urea
equipments.

Precautions
1. Useshort are and stringer bead to restrict heat mput.
2. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour.
Note  Batox-F conforming to AWS E316L-15is alsoavailable.
