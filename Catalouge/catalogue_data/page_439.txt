EN ISO 24598-A
Characteristics  Applications 
Copper Coated Low Alloy Solid Wire for submerged are welding specially designed for
welding 1.25% Cr-0.50Mo steels. These wires are suitable for welding of creep resistant 
similar composition of high strength steels. R designator is applicable for ultra low
residuals which results low Brusea to factor (X- Factor) Autotherme Grade-LR low alloy
solid wire is suitable for welding of various structural  Pressure vessel steels Main areas
of application are associated with steam generating power plant piping turbine castings
steam chests valve bodies and boiler super heaters like AS87T Gr 11 12 A182 F11  F12
