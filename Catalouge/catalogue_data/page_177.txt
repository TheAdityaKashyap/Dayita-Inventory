Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated electrode depositing low carbon 19%Cr-10Ni stainless steel weld metal
which has excellent resistance to Intergranular Corrosion The weld metal has higher
resistance to cracking oxidation and sealing at elevated temperatures tis ideally suited
for welding of stainless steels of similar composition hike 304L and equivalents for
overlays surfacing and repairing castings of similar materials
