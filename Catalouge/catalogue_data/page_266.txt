Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
BOR-B is a rutile coated electrode producing an air hardening type weld metal for
hardfacing of carbon and low alloy steels. The weld metal is highly resistant to abrasive
wear and has a fair degree of toughness. Ideally suited for applications in which abrasion
resistance is required with a fair degree of toughness. Typical applications include brake
shoes shear blades wheels cams gears pulleys drive sprockets ete.

Precautions 
1 Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 150C for 1 hour.
2. Maintain short arc and avoid weaving.
5. Use suitable buffer layers and preheating depending on the material composition and
thickness
