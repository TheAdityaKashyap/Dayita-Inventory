SHC-SIX ae
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
SHC-Six is an unique electrode operating on AC / DC() depositing an air hardening weld
metal which has excellent resistance to severe abrasion with moderate impact as in the
case of mlexpeller worms dipper teeth scraper blades screw convevers etc.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 200-24(C for 1 hour.
2. Useshortarcand stringer beads.
5. Use suitable buffer layers and preheat depending on base material composition
ant thickness.
