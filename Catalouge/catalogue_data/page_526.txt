Recommendations for the storage re-drying and handling
of DH Secheron covered electrodes
General Information
All coverad electrodes are sensitive to moisture re-absarption to a greater or lesser degree.
Care must be taken during storage and handling to prevent moisture being re-absorbed.
Storage
Covered electrodes of any type will pick up moisture only very slowly if they are stored in the
following climatic conditions.
Temperature Relative Humidity
5-15C  60%
16-25C  50%
above 25C  40%
During the winter itis possible to have low relative humidity by keeping the temperature in
the storeroom at least 10C above the outdoor temperature. During certain periods in the
summer and ina tropical climate sutficiently low relative humidity can be maintained by air
dehumiditication If the electrodes have been stored in a cold place allow them to reach
ambient temperature before breaking the package
VacPac
Electrodes in VacPac will not pick up any moisture during storage. They require no re-drying
before use provided the package is undamaged. This is indicated by the vacuum in the
package.
Re-drying
Low-hydrogen basic electrodes should be re-dried before use whenever there are
application requirements relating to weld metal hydrogen content and radiographic
soundness (not needed for VacPac). Acid rutile stainless electrodes and all types of basic
electrode may produce pores in the weld if they have not been stored in sufficiently dry
conditions. Re-drying the electrodes will restore their usability Mild steel rutile and acid
electrodes normally require no re-drying. Cellulose electrodes must not be re-dried.
Electrodes which are seriously damaged by moisture can normally not be re-dried with first-
class results. These electrodes should be scrapped
