Characteristics  Applications 
F 908-D2 is a copper-coated solid wire available in bright finish. The wire gives stable are
amooth welding performances and deposits radiographic quality welds. This wire is
recommended for welding of molybdenum (-0.5%) containing high strength fine-grained
structural steels. The wire also is suitable for welding of penstock pipe-line fabrication of
earth moving equipments ete. where hich tensile strength property is desired from the
weld metal. Suitable for welding of ASTM steels S4-455/ SA-455M Gr.60 Gr.65 Gr.70
steels of SA-515/ SA-515M Gr.60 Gr.G5 Gr.70 steels of S4-516/ SA-516M Class 1 of A
erades of SA-533/ SA-533M ete.
