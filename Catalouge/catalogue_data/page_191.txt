Characteristics  Applications 
DH 309L-17 is a stainless steel electrode depositing an extra low carbon 23%Cr-15%Ni
weld metal. t works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic. Better
welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal fillet
welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. The weld metal has excellent mechanical properties and possesses good
oxidation and scaling resistance at clevated temperatures. Ideally suited for welding
stainless steels wrought and cast materials of similar composition welding of 18/8 type
stainless steels to carbon steels for buffer lavers for welding clad side of 18/8 clad stainless
steels etc
