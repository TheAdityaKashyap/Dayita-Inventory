Compile Welding Support
Codification 
EN ISO 2560-A R424 B92
Characteristics  Applications 
Aniron powder low hydrogen type electrode producing a tough and ductile weld metal for
welding heavy and rigid structures eubjected to dynamic loading and impact. The weld
metal is of radiographic quality and displays remarkable impact strength even at -50C
Typical applications include welding of carbon steels steels sensitive to hydrogen
embrittlement heavy and rigid structures pressure vessels and equipment subjected to
severe stress and requiring good toughness properties at sub-zero temperatures down to -
50C
