Characteristics  Applications 
DK-18Ni(Mod) is a basic coated low hydrogen electrode for low temperature application
welding. Suitable for welding of DMR grade fine-grained steel heavy section fabrication
pressure vesselspenstock pipelines fine grained quenched  tempered steels ete where
high stress  dynamic loadingservice applications are involved. The weld metal is of
radiographic quality. Typical material gradessuitable for welding with this electrodes are-
DMR 249A C/D grades of ASTM SA-414 Grade 55  60 steels of SA-516 Steels
conforming to SA-814 S 2002 18 2062 and equivalent prade of steels.
