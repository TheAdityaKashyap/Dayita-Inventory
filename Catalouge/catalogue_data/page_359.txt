Characteristics  Applications 
FW 430 is a solid wire for TIG process available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit. Weld metal possesses excellent resistance to corrosion abrasion and impact. It is
designed for joining of similar alloys and for surfacing and overlay application on unalloved
steels. Ideally suited for surfacing of valves impellers turbine blades ete.
