Characteristics  Applications 
Supratherme(Spl)Mod is a basic coated iron powder type high yield and hydrogen-
controlled electrode Easy to operate in all conventional welding posttions Radiographic
quality welds having excellent cracking resistance. Ideally suited for welding carbon
steels used in the construction of equipment subjected to heavy dynamic load impact and
severe service conditions in sour pas service.
