Characteristics  Applications 
FW 317L ts a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow
stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality welds tis ideally suited for welding of stainless steels of similar composition and
their equivalents Low carbon weld metal increases the resistance to intergranular
corrosion tis also excellent resistance against Sulfuric Sulfurous and phosphoric acids.
