Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2307-17 is a special electrode for welding lean low molybdenum duplex stainless
ateels. The weld metal possesses excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking with
Increased strength It works well with transformer and good re striking characteristic.
Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal
fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. t is ideal for welding lean duplex stainless steels which include UNS 832101 and
UNS 8323804.
