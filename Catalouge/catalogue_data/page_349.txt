Characteristics  Applications 
FW 309L is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow
stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality weld deposit The weld metal has excellent mechanical properties and possesses
good oxidation and scaling resistance at elevated temperatures It is ideally suited for
welding stainless steels wrought and cast materials of similar composition welding of
18/5 type stainless steels to carbon steels for buffer layers for welding clad side of 18/8 clad
stainless steels ete.
