Characteristics  Applications 
FW 1228 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow
stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality welds. It is ideal for welding Ni-Cr-Mo alloys to themselves and to steel and for
surfacing steel. The wires are use in pressure vessel fabrication for -196C to 40C
otherwise up to the scaling resistance temperature of 1200C (sulphur free atmosphere).
It ig also suitable for welding Ni base alloys to steel. Ideal for valves valve seats
impellers guide points bushing bearings journals hot working tools like hat shear
blades forging dies trimming dies piercing punches etc.
