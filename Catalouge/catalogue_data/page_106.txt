Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5 
Characteristics  Applications A
Supratherme-NM(Mod)HAR is basic coated moisture resistant low hydrogen high purity
electrode for NACE requirements. Radiographic quality welds having excellent cracking
resistance excellent toughness to withstand heavy dynamic loading and impact. Ideally
suited for welding fine grained steels low alloy steels subjected to sub-zero temperature
applications down to -60C. Ideal for welding heavy sections highly restrained joints
subjected to dynamic loading. Ideal for pressure vessels tanks spheres etc
