Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-S6R is an alloy steel flux cored wire containing nickel and few micro-alloying
elements. The wire is suitable for welding of moderate strength (Yield strength490 Mpa)
fine-grained steels to meet sub-zero impact resistance property down to -30C. The wire is
suitable for positional welding application results easy slag removal and has excellent
welders appeal euitable with COArCO gaz shielding. Weld bead is smooth  uniform
and satisfies the requirements of radiographic quality Maxfil-46R is designed for single
and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels like A/B
grades of SA-205 A/B/C grades of SA-662 etc. This wire is used for fabrication of penstock
pipelines pressure vessels  valves refineries off-shore structures and similar
applications ete.
