AWS SPA 5.5  10018-D2H4R
Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated low hydrogen moisture resistant electrode for welding high tensile steels.
The weld metal is of radiographic quality The electrode possesses excellent operating
characteristics and is suitable for welding in all positions. The extra low hydrogen content
reduces susceptibility from hydrogen induced cracking. The weld metal possesses high
strength together with good notch toughness. Ideally suited for welding fine-grained
steels high strength steels. QT steels castings used in the fabrication of structures
bridges penstocks and other components
