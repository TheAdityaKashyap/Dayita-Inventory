Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-12R is an all-position mild steel ux cored wire designed for optimum performance
when using LOO%CO shielding. The wire is characterized with smooth metal transfer
uniform welding even on vertical-up stringer beads and easy slag removal. Filler contour is
flat to slightly convex with equal leg lengths and uniform sidewall wetting. Weld metal is of
radiographic quality Maxfil-12R is designed for single and multi-pass welding of low and
medium carbon steels ikeSA-36 A/B/C/D grades of SA-283 A/BYC grades of SA-285 AJB
grades of BA-414 ete.
