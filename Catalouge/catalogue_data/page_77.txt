Codification 
a
Characteristics  Applications 
Moisture resistant hydrogen controlled basic coated electrode for producing tough and
ductile weld of radiographic quality in Boilers Pressure vessels Medium carbon steels
Cast steel and problematic steels. The weld metal is clean and has low level of impurities
thus having unique properties. The electrode can be used in all conventional positions of
welding Itis ideally suited for welding carbon steels used in the construction of equipment
subjected to heavy dynamic load impact and severe service conditions in sour gas service.
Typical Chemical Composition Of All Weld Metal (%) 
Typical
Corrosion Test  The weld metal meets the requirements as per
NACE TM-01- 77- 96 (S3CC) and TM-02-84-96 (HIC).
Diffusible Hydrogen Content 4 ml / 100 gms of weld metal Max.
Moisture As Conditioned 0.30 Max.
Moisture As Exposed (80% RH 27C For 9 Hrs) 0.40 Max.
Advantage Electrodes are Vacuum packed no need of drying and can be
used straight on the job.
