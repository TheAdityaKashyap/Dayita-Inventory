Characteristics  Applications 
A heavy coated low hydrogen iron powder type electrode ideally suited for producing
tough and ductile welds of radiographic quality in boilers pressure vessels and heavy
structures subjected to dynamic loading. The electrodes have a metal recovery of about
115%. Some typical applications include heavy structures subjected to dynamie loading
and impact highly restrained joints coaches wagons penstocks boilers pressure
