Characteristics  Applications 
Supratherme-Ni(Spl) is a basic coated low hydrogen iron powder type electrode yielding
a weld metal containing 1.5%Mn and 0.7%Ni. Excellent quality welds for welding heavy
sections of fine grained high strength steels with particular reference to low temperature
service down to -60C. Typical applications include welding of fine grained QT steels for
pressure vessels tanks penstocks where high strength and sub-zero temperature
toughness properties are of importance.
