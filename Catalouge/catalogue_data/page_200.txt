Characteristics  Applications 
Secheron 310L is a special electrode depositing 25% Cr-20%Ni with low carbon  low
impurity content in weld metal. A soft  smooth are which is easy to strike  re-strike.
Better welder appeal with easy slag detachability Provide weld metal of X-ray Quality.
The weld metal has got excellent corrosion resistance to corrosion in nitric acid inter.
granular corrosion  pitting. Due to its excellent corrosion resistance used for heat
exchanger tube  pipe in process that treat in nitric acid acrylic fibers ammonium nitrate
 processing of nuclear reactor fuel.
