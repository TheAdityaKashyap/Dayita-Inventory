Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated extra low hydrogen electrode ideally suited for welding high strength steels
QT steels The weld metal is of radiographic quality and possesses excellent strength
combined with good toughness. Ideal for welding high strength steels under the site
conditions having high relative humidity and higher joint restraints as the extra low
hydrogen levels ensure freedom from hydrogen induced cracking

Precautions 
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrode at 400C for 01 howr.
Keep the minimum heat input during welding.
Controlling preheat and inter pass temperatures between 120-150C.
Use stringer beads and minimize weaving.
