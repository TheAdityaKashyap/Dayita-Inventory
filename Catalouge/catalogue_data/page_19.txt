OUR PROFILE
Batox-MoN A basic coated welding electrode
depositing 18%Cr-11GNi-2%%Mo-N type weld metal.
The deposit displays good crack resistance and
excellent creep strength and resists scaling at
elevated temperatures.
Cromotherme-5L Basic coated low carbon  low
hydrogen type electrode conforming to ES018-B6L
classification
2004 Cromotherme-9L Specially designed for welding of
ferritic martensitic chrome steel conforming to
K8018-B8L classification.
Rutox-Mo(H) A stainless steel electrode depositing
L8%Cr-11%Ni-2.3%Mo with high carbon provides
higher tensile and creep strength at elevated
temperatures.
Batox-D(Spl) Basic coated electrode yielding an
extra low carbon 18%Cr-12%Ni-2.3%Mo-N weld
deposit highly resistant to intergranular corrosion.
2004 LoTherme-625 Low heat input hardfacing electrode
for reconditioning of worn-out MM steel and Gr.S0A
points and crossings for use in high traffic density
S5GMT.
Nitherme-2.5(Mod) A low hydrogen electrode
depositing 2.2% N1-0.30%Cr-003%T1 weld metal. Ideal
for welding fine grained and Nickel steels for service
temperatures down to -60C
DH672 Deposits high Nickel alloy containing
Cr-W-Mo Weld deposit resist heat and heavy impact.
Ideal for hot working tools.
Batox-B(N) A stainless steel electrode depositing
19%Cr-10%Ni-0.08%N weld metal which has
excellent resistance to intergranular corrosion.
2006 DH 320 Conforming to E320 - 16 classification.
2006 Molytherme-Extra(Mod) A low hydrogen iron
powder electrode with superior toughness.
