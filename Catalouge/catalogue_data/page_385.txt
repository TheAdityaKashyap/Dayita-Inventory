Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-37R is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high strength fine
grammed quenched  tempered steels to meet sub-zero impact resistance property. The wire
fives optimum performance under CO shielding and deposits radiographic quality weld
metal. The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal The wire sets low
diffusible hydrogen content (4ml/100gm) in the weld metal. Maxfl-37R is designed for
single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels
like AJB grades of SA-203 A/B/C grades of SA-662 BIC grades of SA-737 N-A-XTRA-
6065 ete. This wire is used for heavy fabrication work subjected to dynamic loading earth
moving equipments off-shore platforms and similar kind of applications etc.
