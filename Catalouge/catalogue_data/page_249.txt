Characteristics  Applications 
DH Secheron 209 is a special purpose stainless steel electrode. This composition are
mast often used to weld AISI type 209 (UNS 820910) base metals. The alloy is a nitrogen
strengthened austenitic stainless steel exhibiting high strength with good toughness over
a wide range of temperatures. Nitrogen alloying reduces the tendency for intergranular
carbide precipitation in the weld area by inhibiting carbon diffusion and thereby
increasing resistance to intergranular corrosion. Nitrogen alloving coupled with the
molybdenum content provides superior resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion in
aqueous chloride-containing media. Electrodes have sufficient total alloy content for use
in joining dissimilar alloys like mild steel and the stainless steels and also for direct
overlay on mild steel for corrosion applications
