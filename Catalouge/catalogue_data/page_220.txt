Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 20/18/6 Cu is a stainless steel electrode depositing an extra low carbon 20%Cr-
18% Ni-6%Mo-0. 7% Cu stainless steel weld metal. The weld metal has excellent resistance
to pitting and crevice corrosion Ideally suited for welding stainless steels of similar
composition. Typical appheations include casting repair heat exchangers and pipelines
for seawater contaminated oil and gas plant pulp bleaching equipments. Suitable for
welding 31254 material CKSMCuWN casting A182 F44 material. ete.
