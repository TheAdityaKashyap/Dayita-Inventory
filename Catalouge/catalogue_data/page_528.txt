General Recommendations for
Submerged Arc Welding (SAW)
1. The flux must be dry. Agglomerated fluxes must be protected from moisture pick-up.
re-drying agglomerated fluxes at specified in product label before use is recommended. The
remaining flux in the welding machine container should be removed and stored in a dry
cabinet and should therefore not be feftin the open container.
2. The fusion faces and the plate in the vicinity of the joint should be clean and dry. The
cleaner the joint the better the chances of obtaining a satisfactory weld. Rust mill scale
paint oil and residue from arc-air gouging or grinding can adversely affect the quality of the
weld metal. The more impurities on the fusion faces the greater the risk of weld metal
defects.
3. The arc voltage must be kept constant. Increased arc voltage results in higher flux
consumption. If the flux contains alloying elements the amount transferred to theweld metal
willincrease as the are voltage increases.
The mechanical properties are obtained according to the welding conditions given in
applicable standards such as EN ISO  AWS
