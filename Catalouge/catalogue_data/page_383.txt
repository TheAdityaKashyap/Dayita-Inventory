Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-S6B(M) is an all position low alloy steel flux cored wire suitable for welding of high
strength and low temperature service steels The wire 1s formulated to use with 100%CO
shielding gas The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal The
deposited weld metal is of radiographic quality. Maxfil-36B (M) is designed for single and
multi-pass welding of similar composition high strength steels and equivalent grade steels
like ASTM A 587 Class 2 HY-80 and other similar high strength steels. Typical
application includes the welding  fabrication of submarines aircraft carriers and many
structural applications
