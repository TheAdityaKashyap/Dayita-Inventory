Characteristics  Applications 
Batox-310H is a Basie Coated Stainless- steel electrode depositing 0.4%C-25%Cr-20%N1
weld metal Having Good operating characteristics. ts a fully austenitic stainless steel
weld metal with controlled impurity element. The weld metal possesses excellent
mechanical properties and resists scaling at high temperatures up te 1200C It is Ideal for
welding similar stainless steels in wrought and cast form like HE- 40) Thermalloy 47 ete
