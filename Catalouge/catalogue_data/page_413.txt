Maxfil-1401G6 is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high tensile
strength steel quenched and tempered steels etc. The weld metal is suitable for
fabrication of dynamically loaded structures and resulta good impact resistant property at
sub-zero temperatures. The wire gives optimum performance under CO shielding with
radiographic quality weld deposits The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag
removal Maxfil-140105 ts designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar
composition steels fine grained steels and equivalent grade steels like HY-80 Sumiten-
610 C/D Grades of SA-225 BIC Grades of SA-543 steele conforming to SA-612 grade
A/BIC grades of 84-738 atc.
