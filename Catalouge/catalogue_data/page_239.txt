Characteristics  Applications 
DH 410 is a high deposition electrode designed for joining of similar alloys and for
surfacing and overlay applications on unalloyed steels and chromium steel having
12.6%Cr The weld deposit displays good resistance to corrosion erosion pitting and
abrasion Ideally suited for surfacing of valves and other components of turbine steam
valves made of 15%Cr steel ete
