Characteristics  Applications 
DH 383-17 is a stainless steel electrode depositing fully austenitic weld metal. It exhibits
excellent resistance to corrosion in non- oxidizing media like Sulfuric acid Phosphoric
acid etc. t works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic Better welder
appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds prod
uce more of spray arc and a finer mppled weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to
concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no porosity. Ideally
suited for welding stainless steels of similar composition and other equivalent grades of
stainless steels.
