Characteristics  Applications 
F Cr-Mo 91s a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish. The wire gives
atable arc smooth welding performances and deposits radiographic quality welds. It is
designed for creep resistant steels. Tt is used for welding base metal of similar
compositions usually in the form of pipe or tubing. Typical applications include welding of
AdS8T Grade plate A335 P9 pipe A213 T9 tubes ete
