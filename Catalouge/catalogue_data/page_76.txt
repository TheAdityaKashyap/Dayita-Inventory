Characteristics  Applications 
Supratherme(Mod) is a basic coated iron powder hydrogen controlled all conventional
position electrode produces radiographic quality welds having excellent cracking
resistance. The electrode ideally suited for welding carbon steels used in the construction
of equipment subject to heavy dynamic load impact and severe service conditions in sour
gas service
