Characteristics  Applications 
Indotherme(Splis a medium coated basic type hydrogen controlled electrode producing a
tough ductile weld metal for welding heavy sections in mild steel medium high tensile
ateels subjected to dynamic loading. Weld deposit displays excellent toughness at sub zero
temperatures down to -45C. tis ideally suited for cast steels difficult steels of unknown
composition and for non- machinable deposits on cast iron Typical applications include
Rail coaches Wagons Ships Road rollers Heavy duty cranes Conveyors Earth moving
machinery Tractors Hydraulic gates Rotary kiln shells Concrete reinforcement rods
Welding cast iron Depositing buffer layer on steels before hardfacing etc.
