Characteristics  Applications 
Cellutherme is a light coated cellulosic type electrodes. The electrodes are characterized
by a deeply penetrating forceful spray type are and readily removable thin friable slag.
Ideally suited for welding in all positions including vertical down. The weld metal
possesses good mechanical properties Ideal for stove pipe technique and faster welding.
Welds are of radiographic quality. It is ideally suited for root pass welding of API 5L X42
and X46 grades. Typical applications include welding of pipes tubes ducts ete.
