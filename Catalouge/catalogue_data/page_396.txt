Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-44B is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high strength fine
erained quenched  tempered steels to meet good sub-zero impact resistance property.
The wire gives optimum performance under CO shielding and deposits radiographic
quality weld metal. The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal Maxtil-
44B is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and
equivalent grade steels like SA-455M Gr60 Gr.65 steels of SA-515M Class 1 of A BC D
grades of 8A-543M This wire is used for fabrication of crane plate carth moving
equipments penstock pipelines and similar high strength applications etc.
