Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-901025 1s a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high tensile
strength steel quenched  tempered steels etc where sub-zero impact resistance
property of the weld metal is also desired. The wire gives optimum performance under CO
shielding with radiographic quality weld deposits. The weld has excellent bead appearance
and easy slag removal with diffusible hydrogen of less than 4m1/100gms of weld metal.
Maxfil-901G5 is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels
and equivalent grade steels like HY-80 NAXTRA-60/65 Sumiten-610 A/B grades of BA-
208 AIBIC grades of SA-662 BIC grades of SA-737 ete
