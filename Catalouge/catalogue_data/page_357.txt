Characteristics  Applications 
FW 410 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives amooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit. Weld metal possesses excellent resistance to corrosion pitting abrasion and
impact. tis suitable for joining of similar alloys and for surfacing and overlay applications
on unalloyed steels. Ideally suited for surfacing of valves and other components of turbine
steam valves made of 14%Cr steel ete.
