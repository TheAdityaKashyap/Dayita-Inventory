CROMOTHERME-91
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  9015-B91
Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-91 is 9%Cr-1%Mo non-synthetic low hydrogen electrode modified with
Aluminium Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen designed to provide improved creep
strength toughness fatigue life oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated
temperatures. tis designed to weld the materials in power plant and refineries. Following
are some of the steels that can be welded with this electrode.
