Characteristics And Applications
Copper Coated solid wire for submerged arc welding. These are suitable for welding of
similar composition high strength  Quenched steels. Autotherme Grade-W low alloy
solid wire is suitable for welding of similar grade steels. The weld metal possesses high
tensile strength and méets the radiographic quality requirements. Especially suitable for
welding of tubes matching composition in power plants Refineries Petrochemicals and
Fertilizer Plants Suitable for welding of ASTM steels Grade ASTM A302 Gr. C D ASS
