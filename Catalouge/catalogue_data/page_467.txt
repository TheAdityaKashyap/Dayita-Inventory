Maxflux SAF-4 is an agglomerated basic type flux having very good performance with
good sub-zero impact properties  extreme resistance to cracking. tis neutral in terms of
silicon and manganese pick-up. Slag is easily removable and bead finish is smooth 
shiny. The diffusible hydrogen content of the weld metal is low. Maxflux SAF-4 is suitable
for single  multi-laver welding of structural steels pressure vessels boilers and other
fabrications involving medium tensile  low alloy steel.
