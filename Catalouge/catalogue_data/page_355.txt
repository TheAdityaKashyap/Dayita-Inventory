Characteristics  Applications 
FW 347 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit The Nb reduces the possibility of intergranular chromium carbide precipitation
and thus susceptibility to intergranular corrosion and high temperature strength. It is
suitable for welding CrWNi stabilized stainless steels of type AISI 347 321 ete.
