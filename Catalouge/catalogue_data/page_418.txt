Characteristics  Applications
Maxfil-309LMo is stainless steel flux cored wire with lower carbon content used to join
stainless steel to carbon and low alloy steels for service below 600C and for overlaying of
carbon and low alloy steels. The presence of Molybdenum provides pitting resistance in a
halide environment The wire have smooth and stable are with good slag detachability
with excellent radiographic quality Maxfil-309LMo is suitable for joining of dissimilar
steels like 304 type stainless steels to mild steel  low allov steel cladding  overlaying
applications joining of ferritic steéls  difficult to weld steels etc.
