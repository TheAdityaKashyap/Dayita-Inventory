Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-9M is a basic coated low hydrogen electrode for depositing 9%0Cr -1%Mo
weld metal. The weld metal is resistant to oxidizing atmospheres up to about TOOC tis
used for welding similar composition plates pipes forging and tubes where sub zero
impact properties are required. Typical applications include welding of A387 Gr.9 plate
Ad34 P pipe A217 C12 castings A213 TS tubes ete
