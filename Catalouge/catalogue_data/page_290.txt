Characteristics  Applications 
Anon-synthetic Inconel type of electrode depositing weld metal of Ni-Cr-Co-Mo alloy. The
weld metal has excellent crack resistance Electrodes are used for welding similar type of
alloys to themselves and to steel and for surfacing steels with Ni-Cr-Co-Mo weld metal The
electrodes are also used for applications where optimum strength and oxidation resistance
is required above 820C  up to 1140C especially when welding on base metal of Nickel-
Iron-Chromium alloys. Specially recommended for welding furnace heating elements
reformer tubes ete.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300-325C for 1 hour.
2. Operate the electrodes wherever possible weld in flat position only.
3. Maintain a short arc use stringer bead and minimize the heat input.
