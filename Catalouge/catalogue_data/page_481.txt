Characteristics  Applications 
Maxflux SAP-13 is a specialflux used to weld structural steels The Flux is specially
designed to meet the tensile strength  Impact requirements The weld metal produces
smooth beads good wetting and excellent slag detachability. The weld metal gives very
less diffusible hydrogen (5 ml/100 gms of Weld Metal) Maxflux SAF-13 is suitable for
single  multilayer welding of various structural Boiler Pressure vessel steels  other
fabrication steels tis suitable for welding of ASTM steels A387 Gr 11 12 A182 F11 F12
