Characteristics  Applications 
DH 820LR-15is a basic type non-synthetic all position electrode depositing low residuals
20% Cr-35%0N1-25%Mo-3.5%Cu-Nb weld metal The elements C Si P and 8 maintained
as low as possible and Nb  Mn are controlled to get better properties The weld metal has
excellent resistance to oxidation and scaling at 1200C continuous service. Quiet and
stable arc. Less spatter loss good head appearance with equal ripples. The control on
chemistry reduces the weld metal fissuring frequently encountered in fully austenitic
stainless steel. DH S20LR-15 is primarily used to weld base metals of similar
composition for applications where resistance to severe corrosion 16 required for a wide
range of chemicals including sulfuric and sulfurous acid and their salts These electrodes
can be used to weld both castings and wrought alloys of similar composition without post
weld heat treatment. The typical applications include H-9A stainless steel for
fabricating carpenter 20 stainless steels etc

Precautions
1. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour.
2. Use short arc stringer bead and smallest possible size of electrode and min. current to
reduce the heat input
