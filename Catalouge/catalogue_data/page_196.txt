Characteristics  Applications 
DH 809Mo-15 is a basic coated stainless steel electrode yielding a weld deposit of 25%Cr-
12%Ni-2.6%Mo which has good oxidation resistance up to 1050C Ideally suited for
welding 18-11-Mo type steels to mild steel welding the clad side of 18-11-Mo clad steels
overlays on ferritic steels buffer layers etc.
