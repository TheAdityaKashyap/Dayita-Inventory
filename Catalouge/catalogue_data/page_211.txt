EN ISO 3581-A
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 320 ts a rutile type non-synthetic all position electrode depositing 20%Cr-35%Ni-
2.4 Mo-3.6% Cu-Nb weld metal. The weld metal has excellent resistance to oxidation and
scaling at 1200C continuous service. Quiet and stable arc. Less spatter loss good bead
appearance with equal ripples. It is primarily used to weld base metals of similar
composition for applications where resistance to severe corrosion is required for a wide
range of chemicals including sulfuric and sulfurous acid and their salts. These electrodes
can be used to weld both castings and wrought alloys of similar composition without post
weld heat treatment The typical applications include HV-9A stainless steel for
fabricating carpenter 20 stainless steels etc.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour
2. Use short are stringer bead and smallest possible size of electrode and min. current to
reduce the heat input.
