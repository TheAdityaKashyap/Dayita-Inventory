Characteristics  Applications 
FW 1225 is a solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable are
and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. t gives radiographic quality welds. It
is used for welding Nickel-Chromium-Cobalt-Molybdenum alloys to themselves and to
steel and for surfacing steel with Ni-Cr-Co-Mo weld metal It is also used for applications
where optimum strength and oxidation resistance is required above 820C up to 1150C
especially when welding on base metal of Nickel ron-Chromium alloys. Specially
recommended for welding furnace heating elements reformer tubes ete.
