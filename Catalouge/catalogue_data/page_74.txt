Characteristics  Applications 
Indotherme(Spl)H4R is a basic coated low hydrogen moisture resistant electrode. It is
suitable for mild steel and medium high tensile steels subjected to dynamic loading high
stresses and impact. Weld deposit displays excellent toughness at sub zero temperatures
down to -45C. Some of the applications include Heavy structures subjected to dynamic
loading Rail coaches Wagons Ships Road rollers Heavy duty cranes Conveyors  other
materials handling plant and equipment Earth moving machinery Tractors Hydraulic
gates Rotary kiln shells Concrete reinforcement rods Welding cast iron Depositing
buffer layer on steels before hardfacing etc.
