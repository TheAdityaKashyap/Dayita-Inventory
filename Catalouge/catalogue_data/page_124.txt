Characteristics  Applications 
Nitherme-3.5(8PL) is a low hydrogen iron powder electrode depositing .5% Ni weld metal.
It is pleasing operating characteristics and weld metal is of radiographic quality. Weld
metal possesses excellent toughness at sub-zero temperatures. Ideal for welding fine
grained Nickel steels for service temperatures down to - 74C Typical applications include
pressure veseels piping valves and tanks used for storage transportation and
distribution of liquefied gases.

Precautions  (For best impact strength)
1. Accomplish minimum heat input during welding by
a. Controlling preheat and interpass temperature.
b. Using smallest size of electrode possible.
c Minimum weaving.
d. Welding in down hand position wherever possible.
2. Deposit maximum number of layers which enables grain refinement
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 500C for 2 hours
