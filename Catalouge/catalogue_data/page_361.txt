Characteristics  Applications 
FW 2553 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit The duplex stainless steel weld metal is characterized by high tensile strength
resistance to stress corrosion cracking and improved resistance to pitting The major
application area includes off  gas industry offshore platforms petrochemical plants
mechanical  structural components demanding high strength together with high
COrPOSION resistance.
