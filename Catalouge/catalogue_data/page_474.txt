Characteristics  Applications
Maxflux SAF-75 15 a high speed welding acidic agglomerated flux for spiral pipe welding.
The flux is suitable for single  multi-pass welding with single wire  multi-wire
applications in both AC  DC polarity. Slag detachahility is good anddeposited weld metal
is ofradiographic quality. Maxflux SAF-75 is suited for fabrication and welding of spiral
pipes smaller diameter pipes (internal and external) penstock pipelines wind mill
towers pre re vessels girder earthmoving equipment structures of off-shore
