Characteristics  Applications 
F Cr-Mo 92 is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish gives amooth
flow stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It deposits 9%Cr-
0.5% Mo-1.7% W and enriched with Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen Tungsten additions
provides adequate creep rupture strength at higher steam pressures and temperatures.
The controlled addition of alloying elements improves the toughness and weldability. It is
designed to weld advanced materials which are being used to improve thermal efficiency
in power plant refineries etc. Ideal for welding steels of similar composition to achieve
adequate creep rupture strength. Some typical materials that are welded with this
consumable are A15 T92 ASS Poe ASST Gr 92 ete.
