Characteristics  Applications 
Nimotherme-1(SPL)Mod is a low hydrogen iron powder electrode yielding a tough and
ductile weld deposit having Ni -0.25%Mo. Ideally suited for welding fine- grained and
nickel steels for service temperatures down to - 40C Typical applications include storage
tanks for hquefied gases like Ammonia distillers in coke oven batteries and petrochemical
industries Algo suitable for welding heavy sections and highly restrained joints subjected
to dynamic loading impact and severe service conditions in sour gas service.
