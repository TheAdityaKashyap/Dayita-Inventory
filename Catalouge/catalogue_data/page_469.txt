Characteristics  Applications  d
Maxflux SAF-4 (PW) is an agglomerated basic type flux having very good performance
with good sub-zero impact properties  extreme resistance to cracking. The flux is
especially designed to meet the tensile  Impact requirements after post weld heat
treatment condition at 620C. slag is easily removable  bead finish is smooth  shiny.
The diffusible hydrogen content ofthe weld metal is low. Maxflux SAF-4 (PW) is
suitablefor single  multi-layer welding of structural steels pressure vessels boilers and
other fabrications involving medium tensile  low alloy steel
