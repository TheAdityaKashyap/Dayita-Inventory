Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  9016-B3
Characteristics  Applications 
Low hydrogen electrode depositing 2.25%Cr-1%QMo weld metal display remarkable
atrength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures up to 676C. It is used for welding
2.25%Cr-1%Mo creep resistant steel and Cr-Mo-V steels resistant to hydrogen under
pressure as well as for cast steels of a similar composition to the weld metal Typical
applications include steam boiler construction welding of steam and super heater piping
power plants oil refmery and chemical plants.
