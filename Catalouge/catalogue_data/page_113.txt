Characteristics  Applications 
Nimotherme-1(SPL) is a low hydrogen iron powder electrode yielding a tough and ductile
weld deposit having 1%Ni - 0.25%Mbo. Ideally suited for welding fine- grained and nickel
steels for service temperatures down to -40C Typical applications include storage tanks
for liquefied gases like Ammonia distillers in coke oven batteries and petrochemical
industries Algo suitable for welding heavy sections and highly restrained joints subjected
todynamic loading impact and severe service conditions
