DH 446L is a unique electrode depositing a stainless steel weld metal having a nominal
composition of 16%Cr-45%Ni-3.6%Cu-Ch weld metal. The weld metal possesses excellent
properties and attains high strength on heat treatment It is ideally suited for welding
martensitic precipitation hardening stainless steels of the type 17-4 PH ete
Typical Chemical Composition Of All Weld Metal (s) 
Typical Mechanical Properties Of All Weld Metal
Heated to 1025-1050C held for 1 hour and air cooled to ambient and then precipitation
hardened at 610-630C held for 4 howrs and air cooled to ambient.

Precautions
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 1 hour.
Itis preferable to weld the 17-4 PH materials in the solution treated and quenched condition
When welded in the solution treated sand quenched condition the 17-4 PH materials do not
require preheat.
