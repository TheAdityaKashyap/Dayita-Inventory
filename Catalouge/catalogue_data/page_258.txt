Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2594-15(NS) is a basic coated non-synthetic electrode depositing super duplex
stainless steel weld metal. The weld metal exhibits high strength high impact energy and
resistance to stress corrosion cracking pitting and crevice corrosion The weld metal
possesses excellent corrosion resistance in marine  paper environments Examples of
application areas are Oil and gas industry Off shore plat forms Petrochemical plants

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-a00C for 1 hour.
2 The heatinput should be in the range of 0.5-15 Kal/mim
3. Please ensure inter pass temperature is less than 10C and better less than 102C
4. For better results solution annealing at 1080-1120C is required.
