Characteristics  Applications 
DH 145L is a special purpose stainless steel electrode depositing 24% Cr-9.5%Ni-
2.9% Mo-1.5% Cu weld metal which is highly corrosive service in fertilizer and chemical
plants. It gives stable and smooth are which 1s easy to strike and re-strike. It is ideally
suited for welding steels of similar composition like HVD-1 CD4MCu AFNOR 2-65 CNDU
21.08 ete.
