AWS SFA 5.5  11018M
EN ISO 18275-B E76 18 N4M2 A H5
Characteristics  Applications 
Basic coated extra low hydrogen electrode ideally suited for welding high strength QT
steels like Welten 80 SA517 grades and their equivalents. The weld metal has excellent
crack resistance and displays high strength combined with good sub-zero impact strength.
Ideal for welding high strength steels under site conditions having high relative humidity
and higher joint restraints as the extra low hydrogen levels ensure freedom from hydrogen
induced cracking.

Precautions
1 Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 400C for 01 hour
2. Keep the heat input during welding to a minimum by controlling the preheat and
interpass temperatures between 120-150C
Use stringer bead and minimise weaving
