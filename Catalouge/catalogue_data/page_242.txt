Characteristics  Applications 
DH 430Nb is a rutile coated electrodes depositing 17%Cr-1%Nb. The weld metal is a
ferritic microstructure with fine grains for welding of similar chrome steels and steel
castings. The weld metal shows good corrosion resistibility and good oxidation
resistibility. This electrode requires suitable post and preheats treatment for obtaining
optimum weld metal properties. The welds are of radiographic quality. It-is also suitable
for first layer in the welding of type 405 and 410 clad steels. Typical applications include
machine parts propeller shafts gas turbine construction pump parts components in oil
refineries ete.
