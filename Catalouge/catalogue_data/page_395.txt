Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-42R is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high strength fine
grained quenched  tempered steels to moct sub-zero impact resistance property down ta
-18C. The wire is suitable for positional welding application results easy slag removal
and has excellent welders appeal. Weld bead is smooth  uniform and satisfies the
requirements of radiographic quality Maxfil-d2R is designed for single and multi-pass
welding of similar composition steels and cuutnale grade steels like HY-80 NAXTRA
60/65 T-1 AB grades of BA-208 A/B/C grades of 5A-662 B/C grades of SA-737 ete. This
wire is used for fabrication of penstock pipelines crane plate earth moving equipments
and similar high strength applications ete.
