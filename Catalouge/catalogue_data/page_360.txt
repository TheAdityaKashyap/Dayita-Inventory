Characteristics  Applications 
FW 2209 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit Deposits have duplex microstructures consisting of an austenite - ferrite matrix
which is characterized by high tensile strength resistance to streas corrosion cracking and
improved resistance to pitting t is used primarily to weld duplex stainless steels which
contain approximately 22.Cr such as UNS S81805 and 832205.
