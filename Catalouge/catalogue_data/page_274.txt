Precautions 
. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 1 hour.
. For repairs prepare area to be welded by removing all cracks or other defects by
grinding or scarfing.
3. Preheat the die blocks up to 425C and maintain temperature during welding.
. Use stringer bead technique.
. Peen the weld when hot to relieve stresses.
3. Post-heat at 540C. Hold at temperature at 1 hour per inch of thickness. Cool in still air
