Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-5L(MOD) is a basic coated low carbon low hydrogen type electrode
depositing a weld metal with 6%Cr-0.5% Mo ideally suited for welding of creep resisting
steels of similar composition where superior notch toughness required at sub-zero
temperatures. Typical applications include welding of 5%Cr-04%%Mo ateels in ofl refinery
chemical plant and equipments. Specifically applicable wherever prolonged heat
treatments are invalved
