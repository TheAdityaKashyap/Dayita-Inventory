Characteristics  Applications 
F 808-D2 is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish. The wire gives
atable arc smooth welding performances and deposits radiographic quality welds. It is
recommended for welding of molybdenum (-0.5%) containing high strength fine-grained
structural steels. The wire also is suitable for welding of penstock pipe-line fabrication of
earth moving equipments ete. where hich tensile strength property is desired from the
weld metal. Suitable for welding of ASTM steels SA-455/ SA-455M. Gr.60 Gr.65 ateels of
4-515/ SA-515M Gr.60 Gr.65 steels of SA-416/ SA-516M Class 1 of A BC D grades of
SA-598/ 84-533M ete.
