Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-31B isa low alloy steel flux eored wire designed for welding of low  medium tensile
steels structures subjected to dynamic loading. The wire gives good performance under
CQ shielding with radiographic quality weld deposits. The wire produces thin  friable
slag covering with shiny bead appearance. Maxfil-31B is designed for single and multi-
pass welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels like D/E/FG grades
of SA-414 Gr.60/Gr.65 steels of SA-515. Gr.60/Gr.65 steels of SA-516 ete. Suitable for
shipbuilding bridge construction pressure vessels  boilers etc
