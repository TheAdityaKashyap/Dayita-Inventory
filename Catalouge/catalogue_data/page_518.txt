Common Gas Metal ARC Welding Defects
The process variables materials or welding procedures can affect the weld quality. Some of
the commonly observed defects in GMA welding and their possible remedies are tabulated
below.
POSSIBLE CAUSES  CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
WELD METAL CRACKS
Too high a weld depth-to-width ratio  Increase the are voltage or decrease
the welding current
Too small a weld bead Decrease the travel speed
5 Rapid cooling of the crater at the end   Fill craters adequately
of the weld
 Use a back step welding technique
at the end to complete the weld bead
1.  Use of multiple pass short circuiting  Clean the previous bead before
type welding (slag) making subsequent passes.
2.  High travel speeds (film type inclusions)  Reduce the travel speed
 Increase the arc voltage
POSSIBLE CAUSES CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
POROSITY
Inadequate shielding of arc and  Increase the shielding gas flow
weld pool
 Remove the spatter from the interior
part of the nozzle
 Eliminate drafts (from fans open
doors etc.) blowing into the welding
arc
 Reduce the travel speed
 Reduce the arc gap
 Hold the gun till the molten crater
solidifies
