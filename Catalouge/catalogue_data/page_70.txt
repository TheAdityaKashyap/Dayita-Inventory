Characteristics  Applications 
Tensotherme is basie coated hydrogen controlled iron powder electrode for welding of mild
steels for critical services. The welds are especially suitable for dynamic loading. It is
specially designed for welding of plant machinery and equipment subjected to critical
service loads in combination with varving temperature cycles for example in fabrication
ofconverter shells for the steel industry
