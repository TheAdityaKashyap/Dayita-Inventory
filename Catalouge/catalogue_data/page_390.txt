Characteristics  Applications 
Masfil-40R is a low alloy steel Mux cored wire designed for welding of high strength fine
prained quenched  tempered steels ta meet sub-zero impact resistance property down te -
20C. The wire is suitable for positional welding application results easy slag removal and
has excellent welders appeal Weld bead is smooth  uniform and satisfies the
requirements of radiographic quality Maxfil-40R is designed for single and multi-pass
welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels like HY-80 NAXTRA-
60/65 T-1 AB grades of SA-208 A/B/C grades of SA-662 B/C grades of SA-737 etc. This
wire is used for fabrication of penstock pipelines crane plate earth moving equipments
and similar high strength applications ete.
