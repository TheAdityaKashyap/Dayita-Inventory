Codification 
EN ISO 3581  25222NLB
Characteristics  Applications 
It is a basic coated type of electrode that produces low carbon low silicon and high
manganese stainless steel weld to ensure free from micro-fissures. It is a fully austenitic
stainless steel that does not have intermetallic phases such as intergranular
carbideprecipitations The nitrogen in the weld metal helps to stabilize and strengthen
theaustenitic phase. The weld metal provides improved corrosion-resistance in nitric acid
environment and urea carbamate environments such as high-pressure strippers. Typical
applications of the welds are in the production and processing of urea and sulphuric acid.
