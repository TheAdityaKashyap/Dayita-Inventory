Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme Cr-Mo 92 is a copper-coated solid wire for GMAW available in bright finish
gives smooth flow stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions It
deposits SwCr-0.6%Mo-1.7%W and enriched with Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen.
Tungsten additions provides adequate creep rupture strength at higher steam pressures
and temperatures. The controlled addition of alloying elements improves the toughness
and weldability. It is designed to weld advanced materials which are being used to
improve thermal efficiency in power plant refineries etc deal for welding steels of similar
composition to achieve adequate creep rupture strength. Some typical materials that are
welded with this consumable are A213 T92 A335 P92 AS87Gr 92 ete.
