Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2595-L7(NS) is a stainless steel electrode which depositing super duplex stainless
steel weld metal. Electrode works well with transformer and good re-striking
characteristic. Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On
horizontal fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the
bead shape is typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range
specified and no porosity. The weld metal exhibits high strength and resistance to stress
corrosion cracking pitting and crevice corrosion. It is ideally suited for welding UNS
Sa2550 S82750 and 832760 (wrought) and UNS J93870 J993580 J9a404 CD4MCuN
(cast) and similar compositions. Examples of application areas are Oil and gas industry
Oil country tubular Food processing Valves and fittings Flue gas de-sulfurizers O4f shore
plat forms Petrochemical plants Mechanical and structural components.

Precautions 
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300C for 2 hours.
Use low current short arc and minimum weaving.
For better results solution annealing at LOS)-1120C is required
