Characteristics  Applications 
Rutox-AH(ST) is a stainless steel electrode producing 19% Cr-10.Ni-Nb stabilized welds.
Weld metal has excellent resistance to inter granular corrosion. Ideal for joining and
surfacing of 18% Cr-8%Ni stainless steel and clad steels of similar composition 18%0Cr-
oNi cast steel and forged steel Cladding carbon steel and low alloy steel Steels
conforming to AISI 304 21347 347H and their equivalents can be welded.
