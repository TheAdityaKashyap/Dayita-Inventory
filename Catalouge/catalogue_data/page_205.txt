DH 310Mo-17 BIE
Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 310Mo-17 is a stainless steel electrode depositing weld metal which possesses
excellent mechanical properties and resists at high temperatures. It works well with
transformer and good re-striking characteristic. Better welder appeal including easy slag
detachability characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a
finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to concave. It has no red hot
tendency within current range specified and no porosity. The electrode is suitable for
welding of heat resisting castings tvpe 31 6clad steels and overlay of carbon stecls.
