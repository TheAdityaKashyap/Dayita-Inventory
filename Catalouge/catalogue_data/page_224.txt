Characteristics  Applications 
Batox-HP40Nb is a basic coated electrode specially designed to match heat resistant cast
alloys. tis also suitable for the Nb free alloys and leaner high carbon Cr-Ni alloys such as
HAO AT40 and IN519 Weld metal is not prone to sigma phase embrittlement and the
presence of eutectic and secondary carbides provide excellent hot strength and creep
resistance in the typical service temperature up to 1150C Typical applications include
pyrolysis coils. and reformer tubes for ethylene production in the petrochemical industry.

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 2 hours.
2. Useshort are stringer bead and low current
8. Avoid build- up of heat during welding.
