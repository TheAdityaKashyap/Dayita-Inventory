ULTRATHERMEM 222
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SPA 5.5  11018M
EN ISO 18275-B E7618-N4M2 A HS
Characteristics  Applications  a
Basic coated hydrogen cantrol electrode with a stable and smooth are that is easy to strike
and restrike. Low spatter and good bead finish. Welds are of radiographic quality. The
weld metal displays good crack resistance and produces sound weld metal possessing
excellent strength combined with good impact properties at subzero temperature. It is
ideally suited for welding high strength Q  T steels like WEL-TEN 80 SA 517 grades and
their equivalents. The electrodes are ideally suited for welding restrained joints in high
strength steels

Precautions
Redry the electrodes at 300C for 01 hour.
During welding the heat input should be kept to a minimum. Preheat and interpass
temperature shall never be more than 120-150C
Use stringent beads and minimize weaving
