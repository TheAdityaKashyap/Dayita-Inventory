Characteristics  Applications 
A medium coated general purpose all position electrode for welding low carbon and mild
structural steels. t gives radiographic quality weld metal The electrode operates with a
quiet arc and deposits a smooth bead with fine ripples. The slag is easily detachable. The
electrode produces minimum spatter and has good striking and re-striking
characteristics The electrode operates well under low OCV transformers and direct
current either polarity. Easy to operate in all positions including vertical down. Typical
applications include welding of steel structures tanks truck frames and bodies
machinery construction aute bodies frames pipes ete.
