NITHERME-2.5(MOD)
Secheron
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
Low hydrogen electrode depositing 2.8%Ni and 0.5% Mo weld metal. Pleasing operating
characteristics. Weld metal of radiographic quality. Ideally suited for welding grain
refined steels and nickel steels for service temperatures down to -40C. Typical
applications include storage tanks for hquefied gases like Ammonia distillers in coke oven
batteries petrochemical industries DMR 249B (AB2) steel etc Also suitable for welding
heavy sections and highly restrained joints subjected to dynamic. loading impact and
SeVere service oon d it ions.

Precautions 
1. For best impact properties accomplish minimum heat input by
 Using smallest size of electrode possible.  Minimum weaving.  Proper control over
inter pass temperatures.  Maximum number of layers. Welding in down hand
position wherever possible
2. Eneure the electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 480C for 01 hour.
