Characteristics  Applications 
FW 308 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality
welds. It 1s ideally suited for welding of stainless steels of similar composition like 304 and
equivalents for overlays surfacing and repairing castings of similar materials
