CROMOTHERME-5L
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  8018-B6L
ECrMo5 B 42 H5
Characteristics  Applications 
Low carbon low hydrogen iron powder producing a weld deposit contaiming 5%Cr 
0.6%Mo which has excellent creep resistance at elevated temperatures up te 540C. The
weld metal displays excellent creep resistance with controlled hardness. The lower levels
of carbon limit in weld metal ensuring higher ductility. Ideal for welding steels of similar
composition Typical applications include welding of 4-%0Cr steels in oil refinery
chemical plant and equipment.
