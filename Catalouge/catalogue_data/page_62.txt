Characteristics  Applications 
NormaX is a medium coated rutile type electrode useful in any welding shop for general
fabrication and maintenance work m mild steel It gives radiographic quality weld metal.
The flux coating is so controlled that the electrode provides excellent performance in all
welding positions expect vertical downward. t works very well even with law OCV
transformers and gives very amooth flow with stable arc with low spatter and amoke The
detachability of slag is very easy and gives uniform ripples with good appearance. Thus
Norma-X has special and exclusive appeal to the welders. The weld metal is ductile and
presents good mechanical properties with consistent quality. It is ideally suited for
welding of all mild steel structures bus body building automobile bodies pipes as well as
other mild steel general applications
Some ofthe typical applications include 
Structural steel Bridges Truck bodies Bus bodies Machinery construction Auto parts
Building structures Steel furniture Rail coaches  wagons Ships Tugs Barges
Dredgers Trawlers Storage tanks Boilers Pipe lines.
