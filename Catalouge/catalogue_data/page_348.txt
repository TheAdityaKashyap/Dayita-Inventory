Characteristics  Applications 
FW 309 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives amooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality weld
deposit. The weld metal has excellent mechanical properties and possesses good oxidation
and scaling resistance at elevated temperatures. tia ideally auited for welding stainless
steels wrought and cast materials of similar composition welding of 18/8 type etainless
steels to carbon steels for buffer layers for welding clad side of 18/8 clad stainless steels
ete.
