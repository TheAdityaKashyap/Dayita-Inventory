ENiCrFe-3
EN ISO 14172
Characteristics  Applications 
Anon-synthetic electrode depositing homogeneous Ni-Cr-Fe alloy composition. It is ideally
sulted for welding alloys of similar compositions to themselves for surfacing steel with
Nickel-Chromium-lron alloy when high Manganese contents are not detrimental for
welding clad side of Nickel Chromium-Iron clad steel and dissimilar metal combinations.
Specially recommended for welding 9Ni Steels for cryogenic service. Also used for
welding of Nickel-Chromium allovs used for high temperature applications like furnace
heating elements and reformer tubes.

Precautions 
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes. at 300-325C for 1 hour
Maintain a short arc stringer bead and minimize the heat input.
Allow the weld to coal down to below 50C before depositing the next layer.
For dissimilar metal welding control the dilution by
a Operating at lower currents
b Using stringer beads and faster welding speeds.
