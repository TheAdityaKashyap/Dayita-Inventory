Characteristics  Applications   
Maxflux SAF- 725 is an agglomerated flux to weld structural steels. The weld metal
possesses good OVN toughness  produces smooth beads and excellent slag detachability.
The weld metal gives very less diffusible hydrogen (5 ml/100ems of Weld Metal) Maxflux
SAF-729 is suitable for single  multilaver welding of various structural pressure vessels
 other fabrication steels. Especially suitable for welding of ASTM steels A204 Grade A
As16Gr. BC  15 2002 type B API Gr. 5L X60-X 80 ete.
