Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2553-17 is a stainless steel electrode which depositing duplex stainless steel weld
metal Electrode works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic. Better
welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics On horizontal fillet
welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. The electrode can be used where resistance to pitting corrosive attack and
resistance to stress corrosion cracking are required. The major application area includes
oil  gas industry offshore platforms petrochemical plants mechanical  structural
components demanding high strength together with high corrosion resistance
