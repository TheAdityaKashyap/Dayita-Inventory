Characteristics  Applications 
DH S08L-17 is a stainless steel electrode for welding 88304 SS83068 and its low carbon
versions. t works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic. Better welder
appeal including easy slag detachability characterstics On horizontal fillet welds
produce more of spray arc anda finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape ia typically flat
to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no porosity The
weld deposit displays good corrosion and crack resistance. It is ideally suited for joining
18-8 stainless steels like AISI 304 308 and its low carbon versions ete. and their
equivalent prades in cast variety.
