Characteristics  Applications 
Batox-F(U) is a semi-basic coated electrode depositing a weld metal which is fully
austenitic in structure has high strength and good crack resistance. The weld metal
displays remarkable corrosion resistance particularly in urea service. Ideally suitable for
welding of AISI 316L and their nitrogen bearing versions particularly for urea service

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour.
2. Use short arc stringer bead smallest size of electrode and minimum current to ensure
minimum heat input
