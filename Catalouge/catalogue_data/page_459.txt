Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme Grade 410 is a martensitic stainless steel solid wire available in bright finish
gives smooth flow stable are  spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives
radiographic quality weld deposit. Weld metal possesses excellent resistance to corrosion
pitting abrasion and impact. This wire can be used in combination with Maxflux 55-4 flux.
Autotherme Grade-410 is desired for joining of similar alloy and overlay applications on
unalloyed steel Ideally suited for values and other components of turbine Steam value
made of 15% Crateel etc
