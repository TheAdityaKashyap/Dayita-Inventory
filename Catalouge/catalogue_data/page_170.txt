Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications
SLA(N) is a low-hydrogen type special stainless steel electrode depositing a stainless steel
weld metal having 16%Cr-8%Ni-8%Mn-0.4%Mo-0.12%N The weld metal highly crack
resistant and it has got high strength and good toughness properties even at different
temperatures. Nitrogen alloying in this weld metal increases wear resiatance and satisfy
galling resistant requirements. It is ideally suited for resisting wear in particle to metal 
metal-to-metal applications. It is also useful for producing stainless steel overlay for
corrosion resistance surfacing layers for hardfacing and work hardenable deposits.
