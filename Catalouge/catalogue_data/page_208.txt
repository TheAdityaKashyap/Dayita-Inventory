DH 316L-17 BIE
Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 16L-17 electrode is low carbon deposits increase the resistance to intergranular
corrosion It warks well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic Better
welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal fillet
welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. It is ideally suited for Joining AISI 316L and its equivalent materials in a
number of industries like rayon dye paper chemical fertilizer petrochemicals ete. It is
suitable for surfacing overlay applications  clad steels.
