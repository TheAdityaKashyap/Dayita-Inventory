Characteristics  Applications 
Non-synthetic basic coated clectrode depositing Ni-Cr-Mo-Nb weld metal. Highly crack
resistant weld also possesses good corrosion resistance characteristics. It has scaling
temperature up to 1100C in air It is ideally suited for welding Cr-Ni-Mo austenitic
stainless steels to themselves to duplex stamless steels to Ni-Cr-Mo alloys and ta steel or
for just overlays. Typical specifications for the Cr-Ni-Mo stainless steel base metal are
AS40 Al67 AlB2 A249 A876 A312 A358 ASTS and A479 most particularly the grade
UNS 831254 / 254 SMO / 6% Mo SS type. In a chloride containing environment the fully
austenitic weld-metal exhibits high resistance to Pitting Crevice Corrosion  Stress
Corrosion Cracking It is ideal for Sulphuric and Phosphoric acid media that has been
contaminated by chlorides. It can also be used for welding of 625 and 825 grade Ni-baged
alloys.

Precautions 
Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300-425C for 1 hour.
Maintain a short are stringer bead and minimize the heat input with an IPT of LOOC
maximum is of vitally importance
For dissimilar metal welding control the dilution by
Operating at lower currents b. Using stringer beads and faster welding speeds
