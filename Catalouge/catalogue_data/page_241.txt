Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 450 NM is a special purpose electrode depositing 16%Cr-5%Ni-1%Mo weld metal
which has excellent resistance to corrosion erosion pitting and impact The electrode
shows very good features quite and stable arc less spatter loss and good bead appearance
It is ideally suited for joining of similar composition GX4CrNiMol6-5-1 material groove
welding and surfacing applications. Typical applications include surfacing of high
pressure valves turbine blades valve seats repairs of runners pumpes-and combustion
building pulp and paper plant equipment etc. The high chromium content enhances the
COrTOSION resistance in water steam and sea atmosphere.
