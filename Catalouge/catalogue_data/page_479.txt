Characteristics  Applications  
Maxflux SAF-11 is an agglomerated special flux to weld 0.5%Cr-0.7%Ni-0.5%Cu
Weathering steels. The weld metal produces smooth beads and good slaz detachability.
The weld metal gives very less diffusible hydrogen (5 ml/100gms. of W.M.).Maxflux SAF-
11 is suitable for single  multilayer welding of various weathering steels. Especially
suitable for welding of Corten steels used in chemical Petrochemicals and railway
industries to resist atmospheric corrosion like ASTM steels Grade ASTM ASsaGr.A Bor
CAT09Gr.50W etc
