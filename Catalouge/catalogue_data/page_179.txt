Characteristics  Applications 
Secheron 08L is stainless steel electrode for welding 88304 8S308 and its low carbon
versions. The weld deposit displays good corrosion and crack resistance. t meets customer
requirements economically. It works well with transformer having low OCW also with
good re-striking characteristic t has no red hot tendency within current range specified
and no porosity. It is ideally suited for joing 18-8 stainless steels like AISI 404 308 and
ite low carbon versions etc. and their equivalent grades in cast variety. It is specially
recommended for welding lower diameter pipes with 1 mm to 3 mm wall thickness / 1 mm
to 3mm thick plates used in stainless steel furniture stairsand general fabrication
