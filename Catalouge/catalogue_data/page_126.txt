NITHERME-3.5L(SPL)
Characteristics  Applications 
Low hydrogen iron powder electrode depositing 3.5%Ni in weld metal Easy to operate in
all conventional welding positions. Radiographic quality welds possesses excellent
toughness even at sub-zero temperatures down to -100C_ Ideal suited for welding fine-
erained and Nickel steels. Typical applications include pressure vessels piping valves
and tanks used for storage transportation and distribution of liquefied gases.

Precautions
1. Forbest impact properties accomplish minimum heat input by
 Using smallest size of electrode possible -Minimum weaving
 Proper control over interpass temperatures. Maximum number of layers.  Welding
in down hand position wherever possible
2. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300C for 2 hours
