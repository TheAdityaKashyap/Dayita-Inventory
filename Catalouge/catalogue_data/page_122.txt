Compile Welding Support
Codification 
 AWSSFASS  E7018-C1L
Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen electrode yielding low carbon 2.5% Ni in the weld deposit. It is ideally
suited for welding fine-grained steels and Ni steels especially for service temperatures
down to -75C. The weld metal possesses strength combined with excellent sub-zero
temperature notch toughness. Typical appheations include storage tanks pressure
vessels containers and piping for liquefied gases like propane and butane

Precautions
1. Re-drv the electrodes at 250-300C for 1 hour.
2. Restrict the heat input toa minimum during welding to achieve better properties
Advantages
Electrodes are vacuum packed no need of redrving  can be used straight on the job
