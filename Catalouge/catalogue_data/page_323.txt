Characteristics  Applications 
Autotherme 316L is a solid wire for MIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth
flow stable arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality weld deposit. The weld metal has excellent resistance to intergranular corrosion
even at elevated temperatures. It is ideally suited for welding stainless steel of similar
composition in wrought or cast form and for overlay application to resist heat and
corrosion. It 1s suitable for number of industries like rayon dye paper chemical fertilizer
petrochemicals etc
