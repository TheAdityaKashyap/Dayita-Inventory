Characteristics  Applications 
A medium coated basic type hydrogen controlled electrode producing a tough ductile weld
metal for welding heavy sections in mild steel medium high tensile steels subjected to
dynamic loading. Also suited for cast steels difficult steels of unknown composition and
for non-machinable deposits on cast iron Typical applications include coaches ships
heavy duty structures earth moving machinery rotary kiln shells cast irons.
