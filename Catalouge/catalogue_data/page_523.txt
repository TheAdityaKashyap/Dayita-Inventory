CAUSES AND REMEDIES FOR FUSION
WELD DISCONTIUITIES
CAUSES
CRACKS
High rigidity of joint
Poor joint fit up
Higher carbon content of weld
metal and/or hardenable -
hase material
Too small a weld bead
High sulphur content in base
or weld metal
Hot cracking
Cracking at the crater
Higher hardenability

CORRECTIVE ACTION
Use preheating
Relieve residual stresses
Minimise shrinkage stresses using back step
or block welding sequences
Adjust root opening all alignment
Use proper electrode
Use buttering layers wherever necessary
Decrease travel speed to increase
cross section of bead
Increase electrode size
Use filler with high level of sulphur fixing
element like Mn
Reduce the heat input.
Minimum joint restraints
Filling up the crater before withdrawing
the electrode
use taper power control device
use hack step welding technique
preheat the job
Post weld heat treatment without
cooling to roam temperature
