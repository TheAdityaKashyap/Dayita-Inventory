 AUTOTHERME GRADE-30sL 222
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.9 -) BRa08L
EN ISO 14343-B S8308L
Characteristics  Applications 
The nominal composition of this wire is 20%Cr10%QN1 ForL grade the carbon content
is 003%. The wire is suitable for welding of base metal of similar composition (AISI 301
8302 304 and equivalent types). Low carbon grade reduces the propensity for carbide
precipitation and offers increasing resistance to Intergranular corrosion. The are 
current carrying characteristics assure excellent performance of outstanding bead and
surface finish. Autotherme Graded0aL can be used in combination with Maxflux 88-4
