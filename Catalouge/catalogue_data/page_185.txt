Characteristics  Applications 
DH 308Mo-17 is a stainless steel electrode deposited weld metal displays good
resistance to cracking corrosion  scaling. Electrode works well with transformer and
good re-striking characteristic. Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability
characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled
weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within
current range specified and no porosity. It is ideally recommended for welding ASTM
CFS8M stainless steel castings. It is also used for welding wrought materials such as type
916 stainless when increased ferrite is desired.
