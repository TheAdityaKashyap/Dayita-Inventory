Characteristics  Applications 
Corefil-Ni(Mod) is a low alloy and hydrogen controlled (4ml max) flux cored wire designed
for welding of medium tensile steels structures subjected to dynamic loading and impact
resistance requirements down to -50C The wire gives good performance under CO
shielding with radiographic quality weld deposits. The wire produces thin  friable slag
covering with shiny bead appearance. Corefil-Ni (Mod) is designed for single and multi
pass welding of ship building grade DMR 249 grade A steels The wire is also suitable for
fabrication of heavy  rigid structure pressure vessels ete.
