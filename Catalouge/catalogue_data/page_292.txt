Characteristics  Applications 
DH1229(N8) is a non-synthetic nickel base electrode. It gives soft and smooth arc which
is easy to strike and re-strike. The weld metal isof radiographic quality and displays a good
combination of strength and impact strength even at -196C Electrodes of sizes up to 3.15
mm dia can be used for welding in all positions. t is recommended to use other sizes in
horizontal and flat positions for achieving better resulta. Ideal for welding 9% Nickel steel
for ervogenic storage tanks for LNG and other similar alloys as well as the clad side of joints
in steel clad with a Ni-Cr-Fe alloy and for welding Ni-Cr-Fe alloys to steel and to other
nickel base alloys

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300-325C for 1 hour.
2. Operate the electrodes wherever possible weld in flat position only.
3. Maintain a short are use stringer bead and minimize the heat input.
