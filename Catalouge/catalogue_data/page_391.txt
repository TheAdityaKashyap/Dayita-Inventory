Characteristics  Applications 
Masfil-41B is a low alloy eteel flux cored wire designed for welding of high tensile strength
steel where sub-zero impact resistance property of the weld metal is also desired. The wire
fives optimum performance under CO shielding with radiographic quality weld deposits
that meet the impact requirements down to -51C The weld has excellent bead appearance
and ensy slag removal Maxfil-41B is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar
composition steels and equivalent grade steels like HY-80 NAXTRA-60/65 T-1 AJB
grades of 84-203 A/BIC grades of 8A-662 B/C grades of SA-737 ete.
