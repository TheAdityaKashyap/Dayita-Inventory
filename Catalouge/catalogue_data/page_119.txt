Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen DC() electrode yielding 2.5%Ni in the weld deposit ideally suited for
welding fine-grained steels and Ni steels especially for service temperatures dawn to -
60C. The weld metal possesses strength combined with excellent sub-zero temperature
notch toughness. Typical applications include storage tanks pressure vessels containers
and piping for liquefied gases like propane and butane.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 250-d00C for 1 hour.
2 Restrict the heatinput toa minimum during welding to achieve better properties.
