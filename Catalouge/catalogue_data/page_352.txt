Characteristics  Applications 
FW 316L is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow
stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality weld deposit. The weld metal has excellent resistance to intergranular corrosion
even at elevated temperatures tis ideal for welding stainless steel of similar composition
in wrought or cast form and for overlay application to resist heat and corrosion. It ia
suitable for number of industries like rayon dye paper chemical fertilizer
petrochemicals ete.
