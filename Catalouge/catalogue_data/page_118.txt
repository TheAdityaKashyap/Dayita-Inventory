Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 250-d00C for 1 hour.
2. Accomplish minimum heat input during welding by
a. Controlling preheat and interpass temperature. b. Using smallest size of electrode
possible. c. Minimum weaving.
3. Depositing maximum number of layers which enable grain refinement.
