CROMOTHERME-24
Codification 
AWS SFA 5.5  E9015-B24
Characteristics  Applications 
A stable and steady arc which is easy to strike and re-strike. Easy slag removal and finely
rippled smooth beads. Weld metal of having lesser impurities i.e. 8 P will improve the
subzera impact property. The electrode ts used for welding similar composition materials
and SA-182 F22V SA-496 F22V  SA-641 22V. Specially applicable wherever prolonged
heat treatments cycles are involved. Basically it is used for fabricating desulphurization
reactors heavy section pressure vessels having similar composition.
