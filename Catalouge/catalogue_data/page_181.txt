Characteristics  Applications 
DH S07 is a special electrode depositing a stainless steel weld metal having 20%Cr-
10% Ni-4.0%Mn-1.0%Mo. The weld metal possess high crack resistant with moderate
atrength. It is ideally suited for moderate strength welds with good crack resistance
between dissimilar steels such as austenitic manganese steel and carbon steel forgings or
castings.
