E7018-CaL
EN ISO 2560-B E4918 N2 A H5
Characteristics  Applications  a
tis low hydrogen  low carbon electrode depositing 1.0% Ni - 025%Mo - 0.02%V weld
metal. Weld metal poss eg excellent strength together with toughness at subzero
temperatures. It is ideally suited for welding low bon grain-retined steels nickel steels
normalized and tempered steels. Typical applications include storage tanks for liquefied
gases like Ammonia distillers in coke oven batteries and pe trocherical industries. Also
suitable for welding heavy sections and highly restrained joints subjected to dynamic
loading impact and severe service conditions
