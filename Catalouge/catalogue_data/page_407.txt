Of  Hi SECHEROW ELECTAOGES
Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-91D1 is an all-position low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of
L.25%Mn-0.5%Mo steel designed to achieve the mechanical properties and corrosion
resistance of the high strength low alloy pressure vessel steels. The slag coverage is
complete and easy to remove This wire burns with low spatter convex bead contour good
slag detachability  minimal fumes with radiographic quality deposita Maxfil-91D1 is
designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar composition stecls and equivalent
erade steels like ASTM A49 A291 and A795. For welding of steels to IS 2062-11 (R- 2016)
pfrade E410 E450 of all quality  2003-2009 (R2018) Grade -IT IS 1875-1992 (R2014)
