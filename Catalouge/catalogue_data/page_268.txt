Characteristics  Applications 
BOR-CR is a basic coated electrode producing an air hardening weld metal which has
resistance to abrasion or heavy impact or both together with machinable hardness up to
30-40H RC The welds are machinable and are ideally suited for applications involving
severe abrasion and impact. Typical applications include reclamations of equalizing
beam etc
