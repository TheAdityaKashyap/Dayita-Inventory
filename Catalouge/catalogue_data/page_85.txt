Characteristics  Applications 
A basie coated low hydrogen iron powder type electrode for welding high tensile steels. The
weld metal is of radiographic quality. Ideally suited for welding high tensile steels QT
steels castings etc. with UTS range of 711Mpa. The weld metal possesses high strength
combined with excellent toughness at sub-zero temperatures

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 300C for 2 hours.
2. When welding grain refined and QT steels control the heat input by using
a Stringer bead. (b) Control over preheat and interpass temperature. (c) Short arc.
