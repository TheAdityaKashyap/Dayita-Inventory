Characteristics  Applications 
Stainless steel electrode for welding of similar and dissimilar steels. The weld deposit
displays good corrosion scaling resistance and crack resistance. It meets customer
requirements economically. t is ideally suited for welding similar alloys in wrought or
caat form It can also used for welding dissimilar metals such as joining SS304L to carbon
steel welding the clad side of SS8304L clad ateels and applying stainless steel sheet lining
to carbon steel shells.
Typical Chemical Composition Of All Weld Metal (%) 
Advantage  Electrodes are Vacumm packed
This electrode can also be made available in moisture resistant vacuum packed cartons
which can be used without redrying
