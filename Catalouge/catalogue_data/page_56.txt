Characteristics  Applications 
Cellutherme-80Mo electrodes have been designed primarily for welding typical high-
strength pipe butt joints in the vertical welding position with downward or upward
progression This electrode operates with a forceful penetrating arc produce deep
penetrating spray-type welding arcs and thin easily removable elag. It is extremely
beneficial for welding of pipes in Stave Pipe Technique both for faster welding and
greater control on penetration of the root runs. The welds are of radiographic quality. Itis
ideally suited for welding of APL 5L-X56 APLSL-A70 piping assemblies.
