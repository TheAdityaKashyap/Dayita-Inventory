OUR PROFILE
stress is not a concern and color match of the base
metal should not be expected It melts at relatively
low temperatures which permit the use of low welding
currents. Commonly used on gears motor housings
machine parts farm equipment large fames etc.
149. 2016 Cromotherme-921 Is basic coated low hydrogen
electrode Weld metal contain 9.5% Cr-1.5%Mo-
10%Co modified with Niobium Vanadium Boron
and Nitrogen designed to provide improved creep
strength toughness fatigue life oxidation and
corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures. It is
designed to weld the materials in power plant and
refineries. It is ideally suited for welding advances
creep resistant GX-13CrMoCoVNb 9-2-1 steel.
2016 Molytherme-CM Is a basic coated low hydrogen
electrode for depositing O.5%Cr-1.1Mo-V creep
resistant weld metal it is ideally suited for welding of
steels of similar it composition. Typical applications
include welding Cr-Mo-V steels used in boilers
pipelines in chemical power plants castings ete.
Cromotherme-7 Is a basic coated low hydrogen
electrode for depositing 7%Cr-0.5% Mo creep resistant
weld metal It is ideally suited for welding of steels of
similar composition Typical applications include
welding Cr-Mo steels used in boilers pipelines in
chemical power plants castings etc.
Molytherme-CM Is a basic coated low hydrogen
electrode for depositing 0.5%Cr-1.1%Mo-V creep
resistant weld metal
