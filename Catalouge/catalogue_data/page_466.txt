Maxflux SAF-2 is an agglomerated Alumina-Rutile type acidic flux to weld medium
tensile structural steels. The slag is easily removable and bead finish is smooth 
shiny. Weld deposit is ofradiographic quality. Maxflux SAF-2 is suitable for single and
multi layer welding of various structural  pressure vessel steels like 152062 ASTM 516
Grode 6070 ASTM A285 Gr. C ASTM A-36 BS1501-151 Gr.400 machine building and
