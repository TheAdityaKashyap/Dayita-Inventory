Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Electrode is depositing 65%.Ni-20%Cr-2%Nb-1.5%Mo weld metal. Radiographic quality
weld metal of superior properties. t is ideally suited for welding alloys of similar
compositions to themselves for surfacing steel with Nickel-Chromium-Iron alloy when
high Manganese contents are not detrimental for welding clad side of Nickel Chromium-
Iron clad steel and dissimilar metal combinations Suitable for overlay of forge plates.
Specially recommended for welding %Ni Steels for cryogenic service Also used for
welding of Nickel-Chromium alloys used for high temperature applications like furnace
heating elements and reformer tubes_

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at. 300-325C for 1 hour.
2. Maintain a short arc atringer head and minimize the heat input.
3. Allow the weld to-cool down to below 50C before depositing the next layer.
