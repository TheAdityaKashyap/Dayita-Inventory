OUR PROFILE
DH 310N (St) lt is a stainless steel electrode
depositing 25%Cr-20%Ni with N weld metal. It is
designed for welding in all conventional positions.
Weld metal possesses excellent mechanical properties
and resists scaling at high temperatures up to
1200C. It is ideally suited for the welding of similar
and dissimilar compositions including hardenable
steels clad steels Carbon -Molybdenum and
Chromium - Molybdenum steels where pre-heat and
post weld heat treatments are impracticable. The
composition designed to withstand high temperature
and pressure in SC  USC boilers.
Supratherme (Spl) CT The weld metal is of
radiographic quality and displays remarkable impact
strength even at -60C. Typical applications include
welding of carbon steels steels sensitive to hydrogen
embrittlement heavy and rigid structures pressure
vessel and equipment subjected to severe stress and
requiring good toughness properties at sub zero
temperatures down to -60C.
130. DH 25/4 Weld metal has excellent performance in
high temperature up to 1100C Weld metal defend
against attack of sulphurous oxidizing or reducing
combustio gases. Electrode is for joining and
surfacing or heat-resistant chromium and chromium-
nickel steel and cast steel of Similar compositions.
Rutox-D(Sp1) It is a rutile coated electrode yielding
an extra low carbon (1.025%max) with ferrite (6-12
FN) in the weld metal. The Weld metal has excellent
resistance to intergranular corrosion even at elevated
temperatures. Ideally suited for welding stainless
steels of similar composition. Ideal for joining
wrought and cast materials in a number of industries
like rayon dye paper chemical fertilizer
petrochemicals etc. Surfacing  overlay applications.
DO 1423 (NS) It is suitable for welding components
in plants for chemical processes with highly corrosive
