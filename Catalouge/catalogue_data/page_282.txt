Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Aspecial type hardfacing electrode depositing Ni-Mo alloy. The weld metal poszesses high
hardness which is retained even at elevated temperature of 560C. Ideal for hardfacing
components which are subjected to abrasion in combination with impact like blast
furnace belt hoppers rolls tong pins ete
