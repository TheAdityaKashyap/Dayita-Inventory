Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-40B is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high strength fine
grained quenched  tempered steels to mect sub-zero impact resistance property down to -
61C. The wire gives optimum performance under CO shielding and deposits radiographic
quality weld metal The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal. Maxfil-
40B is designed for single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and
equivalent grade steels like HY-80 NAXTRA-60/65 T-1 A/B grades of 5A-203 A/BIC
grades of SA-662 ete. This wire is used for fabrication of crane plate earth moving
equipments off-shore platforms and similar high strength applications ete.
