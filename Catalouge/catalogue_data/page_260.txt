Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2595(N8) is a non-synthetie electrode depositing super duplex stainless steel weld
metal. The weld metal exhibits high strength and resistance to stress corrosion cracking
pitting and crevice corrosion. t is ideally suited for welding of super duplex stainless
steels LINS 832550 832750 and S32760 (wrought) and UNS J8sa70 J9as80 Jaded
CD4AMCuN(cast) and similar compositions. Examples of application areas are Oi and gas
industry Oil country tubular Food processing Valves and fittings Flue gas de-sulfurizers
Off shore plat forms Petrochemical plants Mechanical and structural components.

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 260-300C for 1 hour.
2. The heat input should bein the range of (.5-1.5 Kd/imm.
3. Please ensure inter pass temperature is lesa than 140C and better less than 102C
4. Forbetter results solution annealing at LOBD-1120C is required
