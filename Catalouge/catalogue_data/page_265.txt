Characteristics  Applications 
BOR-A(R) is a hardfacing electrode operating on AC / DC(-) depositing an air hardening
weld metal . The deposit displays excellent toughness and ability to withstand heavy
impact loads and has excellent resistance to rolling and sliding friction. The weld deposit is
machinable Ideal for rail points and crossings axles wheels gear shafts couplings
pinion teeth rollers sprockets ete.

Precautions
1. Use short are.
2. Use low current.
3. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 140C for (1 hour.
4. Ifthe base material has the carbon content of more than (.25% a buffer layer using a low
hydrogen electrode is recommended.
