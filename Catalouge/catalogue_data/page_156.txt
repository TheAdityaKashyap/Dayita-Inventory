CROMOTHERME-9L
Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen type electrode specially designed for welding of ferritic-martensitic
chrome steels. The weld deposit contains low carbon 9%Cr-1%sMo air hardanable weld
metal calls for suitable preheat and post weld heat treatment. Weld deposits are of
radiographic quality. Typical applications include welding of ASS7 Gr.9 plate A335 PS
pipe A217 Cl 2esstings A215 TS tubes ete.
