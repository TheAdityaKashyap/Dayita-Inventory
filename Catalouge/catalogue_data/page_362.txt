Characteristics  Applications 
FW 2594 1s a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions The weld metal exhibits high
strength high impact energy. and resistance to stress corrosion cracking pitting and
crevice corrosion. The weld metal possesses excellent corrosion resistance in marine 
paper environments. Examples of application areas are Oil and gas industry Off shore
plat forms Petrochemical planta. Mechanical and structural components. It is suitable for
welding. ASTM AS90/A995 Gr. 54 CESMn UNS J93404 Super Duplex 2507 UNS
