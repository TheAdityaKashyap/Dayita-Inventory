Characteristics  Applications 
SIA is a basic coated multipurpose stainless steel electrode producing a weld metal of
L8tiGr-O%oNi-5Mn The weld metal has excellent crack resistance and has good sealing
resistance up to 840C. Ideal for joining ferritic to austenitic steels armour plates
austenitic manganese steels heat resistant steels dissimilar materials for buffer layers
