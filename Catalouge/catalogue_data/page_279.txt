Characteristics  Applications 
SMA is a basic coated electrode operating on AC/DC() producing a tough austenitic
manganese steel weld metal. The deposit work hardens in service and has excellent
resistance to wear by impact. Typical applications include surfacing of parts subjected to
abrasion and heavy impact as in the case of crusher jawa bucket teeth and lips. rail
