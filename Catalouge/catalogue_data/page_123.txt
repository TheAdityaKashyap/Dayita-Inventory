Characteristics  Applications 
A unique low hydrogen type electrode yielding 3.5%Ni in the weld deposits Specially
designed for welding fine-grained steels and nickel steels for service temperatures down to
75C. Typical applications include pressure vessels piping systems valves and tanks
used for liquefied propane butane ethane acetylene CO2 and even liquefied ethylene.
