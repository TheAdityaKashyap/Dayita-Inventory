Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-12M is an all-position flux cored wire with Argon-CO gas shielding to deposit weld
metal with improved impact resistance characteristics. The wire facilitates easy
deposition of vertical-up stringer beads and provide fat to slightly convex contour with
equal leg lengths and uniform sidewall wetting. The slag coverage is complete and
designed for easy removal The deposited weld metal contains very low diffusible hydrogen
and is of radiographic quality. Maxfil-12M is designed for single and multi-pass welding of
low and medium carbon steels like A-36/ A-36M A/B/C/D grades of SA-283 A/B/C grades of
SA-285 A/B grades of SA-414 ete
