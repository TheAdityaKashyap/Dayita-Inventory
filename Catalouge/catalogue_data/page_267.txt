Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
BOR-C is a basic coated electrode producing an air hardening weld metal which has
excellent resistance to abrasion or heavy impact or both together. The welds are non-
machinable and are ideally suited for applications involving severe abrasion and impact
Typical applications include cane cutting knives crusher hammers jaws rollers rock
drills tractor grousers etc
