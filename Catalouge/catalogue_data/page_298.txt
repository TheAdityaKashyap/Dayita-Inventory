Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 1400 is a nickel base electrode depositing a Ni-Cr-Mo-W-Co deposit. The weld deposit
has excellent heat resistance and strength up to LO00C. The deposit work hardens under
impact load and the hardness is retained even at elevated temperatures. The deposit has
high resistance to static or eyelic loads at high temperatures Ideally suited for surfacing
applications and joining applications to resist corrosion due to chloride environment and
for surfacing of hot working tools dies punches ete.
