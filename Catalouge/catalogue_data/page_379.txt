Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-34B(MDH) is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of medium
tensile (containing Nickel Molybdenum) steels structures subjected to dynamic loading.
The wire gives good performance under Argon-CO ens shielding with radiographic quality
deposits. Presence of Nickel  Molybdenum in the weld metal imparts an excellent crack
resistance  toughness properties. Maxfil-34B (MDH) is suitable for single and multi-pass
welding of similar composition steels fine grained steels and equivalent grade steels like
Gr. Fl of SA-182 and SA-346 Gr. A of SA-204 Gr. T1/T1la/T1b of SA-209 Gr. WC1 of BA-
217 Gr. A of BSA-302 Gr. Pl of 5A-835 Class 1 of A grade of SA-533 etc. Suitable for
fabrication of heavy machinery steel plant equipments  structures high strength
