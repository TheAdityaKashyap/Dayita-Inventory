and impact. It is specially suited for welding
O6XH3DL grade castings.
BOR-F is a basic coated electrode producing an air
hardening weld metal which has excellent resistance
to abrasion.
LoTherme-410C is ideally suited for the repair of all
tool steels. It is also suitable for repair of shearing
blades planer plate anvils drills.
LoTherme-444C is ideally suited for buildup
directly on cast iron draw dies including gray
nodular ductile cast irons.
LoTherme-623F Typical applications include cane
cutting knives crusher hammers jaws rollers rock
drills tractor grousers ete
DH 409Nb Is a rutile coated stainless steel
electrode depositing 12%Cr-0.5%Ni-1%Nb weld metal.
Added Nb in weld metal to produce a ferritic
microstructure with fine grains.
Maxfil-MC-31 Is a gas shielded metal-cored wire
designed for welding of low  medium tensile steels
structures subjected to dynamic loading.
Nimotherme-1(Spl)Mod Is a low hydrogen iron
powder electrode yielding a tough and ductile weld
deposit having 1%Ni-0.25%Mo. Ideally suited for
welding fine-grained and nickel steels for service
temperatures down to minus 40C.
DH310(Mod) Is a low carbon 25% Cr-20%Ni-4%Mn
type electrode for welding steels of similar
composition The weld metal has excellent resistance
to oxidation and scaling up to 1200C.
DH1233 Electrode for welding similar and
dissimilar alloys like mild steel stainless steel 
nickel base alloys. Weld metal has good pitting and
crevice corrosion resistance. It resists scaling up to
1100C
