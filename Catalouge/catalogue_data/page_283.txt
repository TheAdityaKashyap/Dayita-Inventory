Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Fenitherme is a special Ferro -Nickel electrode designed for repair welds as well as for
jolning components of various types of cast irons including prey and nodular east irons
and for welding them to steel and some ferrous and non-ferrous materials It 1s ideally
suitable for rectification of defective casting in cast iron foundry engine heads pump
casings impellers rope drums ingot moulds and a variety of cast iron machine parts and
equipments. It is also suitable for welding cast iron to stecl and some ferrous and non-
ferrous materials.

Precautions 
Re-dry the electrodes at 100C for 1 hour
Grind the area to be welded so that the casting skin is removed.
Clean the area free from all contaminates by degreasing burning brushing grinding
etc
Ifa crack has to be repaired drill crack arrester holes at the end of the cracks. Remove
the crack completely by gouging grinding etc. and ensure complete removal by a dye
penetrant test.
Deposit the welds in small lengths of 50mm at atime.
Peen the welds
After welding allow the casting to cool slowly.
These are the general steps in cast iron welding. However the procedures may have to
be modified depending on the job
