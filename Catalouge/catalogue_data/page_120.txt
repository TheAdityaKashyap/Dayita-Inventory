Codification 
AWS SPA 5.5  7018-CiL
Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen electrode yielding low carbon 2.5% Ni in the weld deposit. It is ideally
suited for welding fine-grained steels and Ni steels especially for service temperatures
down to -75C The weld metal possesses strength combined with excellent sub-zero
temperature notch toughness Typical applications include storage tanks pressure
vessels containers and piping for liquefied gases like propane and butane.
