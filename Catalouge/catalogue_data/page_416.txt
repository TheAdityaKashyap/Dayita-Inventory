Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-308H is stainless stecl flux cored wire designed for optimum performance with
100% OO gas shielding. The higher carbon content provides improved creep properties at
temperature above 400C. This wire is designed with fast freezing slag characteristics and
good slag detachability. The wire welds satisfactorily when welding in the flat  horizontal
position The weld metal is of radiographic quality resistant to cracking and very good
oxidation  scaling resistant at elevated temperature. Maxfil-308H is designed for
welding of austenitic stainless steels such as 404H for elevated temperatures and their
equivalents with excellent weldability
