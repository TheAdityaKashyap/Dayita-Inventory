Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-410 is stainless steel flux cored wire designed for optimum performance with
100% CO gas shielding. This wire provides the excellent usability with stable arc less
spatter good head appearance. The wire welds satisfactorily when welding in the flat
horizontal  fillet position. Maxfil-410is 13% Cr martensitic stainless steel flux cored wire.
tis used for overlay welding on valve seat surface because of its martensite structure in as
welded which shows high hardness and wear resisting properties. It will be showed good
ductility and excellent corrosion resistance after post-weld heat treatment at G00850C
and itis suitable for welding of AIST 410 403 420-11 and 42032 Normally pre-heat  post
heat treatments is necessary at 205400C
