Characteristics  Applications 
FW 310 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives amooth flow stable
art and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality
welds. The weld metal has excellent resistance to oxidation and scaling up te 1200C It is
ideally suited for the welding of similar and dissimilar compositions including hardenable
steels clad steels Carbon - Molybdenum and Chromium - Molybdenum steels where pre-
heat and post weld heat treatments are impracticable.
