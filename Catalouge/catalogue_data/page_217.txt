Characteristics  Applications 
DH 3865 iz a non-synthetic rutile coated stainless steel electrode depositing a weld metal
containing low carbon 20%%Cr-25%Ni-5%Mo-2%Cu which exhibits excellent resistance to
corrosion in non oxidizing media like sulfuric acid phosphoric acid acetic acid formic
lacid fatty acids oxalic acid etc Soft and stable arc which is easy to strike and re-strike.
Low spatter. Smooth weld beads. Easy slag detachability. It ia ideally auited for welding
materials for application where phosphoric sulfuric acids. and other non-oxidizing
solutions are encountered. The addition of Mo and Cu in the weld metal helps in resisting
corrosive attack of these solutions. Itis particularly suited for welding Carpenter 20 HV9
HVA Uranus B6 UHB S04L Sandvik 2RK65 and similar materials which are used for
these service conditions.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour
2 Use stringer beads short arc and smallest possible size which helps in reducing the
heat input
