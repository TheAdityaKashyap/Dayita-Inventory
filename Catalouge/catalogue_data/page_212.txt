Characteristics  Applications 
DH 820LR is a non-synthetic all position electrode depositing 20%Cr-35%Ni-2.6%Mo-
4.6% Cu-Nb weld metal. The elements C Si P and  maintained as low as possible and Nb
 Mn are controlled to get better properties. The weld metal has excellent resistance to
oxidation and scaling at 1200C continuous service. Quiet and stable arc Lesa spatter loss
good bead appearance with equal ripples. The control on chemistry reduces the weld metal
fissuring frequently encountered in fully austenitic stainless steel.It is primarily used to
weld base metals of similar composition for applications where resistance to severe
corrasion is required for a wide range of chemicals including sulfuric and sulfurous acid
and their salts. These electrodes can be used to weld both castings and wrought alloys of
similar composition without post weld heat treatment. The typical applications include
H-9A stainless steel for fabricating carpenter 20 stainless steels etc

Precautions 
Ensure the electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour.
Use short arc stringer bead and smallest possible size of electrode and min. current to
reduce the heat input
