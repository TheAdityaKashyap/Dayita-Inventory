Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen iron powder type electrode yielding a 0.5% Ni in the weld metal. Ideally
sulted for welding fine-grained steels heavy sections and restrained joints requiring goad
Impact strength at sub-zero temperatures down to -50C. Typical applications include
welding of C-Mn grain refined steels heavy sections and restrained joints requiring good
impact strength at sub-zero temperatures down to -A0C
