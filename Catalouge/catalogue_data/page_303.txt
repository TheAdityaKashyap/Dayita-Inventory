Compile Welding Support
Codification 
EN ISO 1071 EC Ni-CI
Characteristics  Applications 
NFM is an electrode depositing high nickel weld metal for welding of cast irons. The
deposit is soft and has good resistance Locracking. Ideally suited for welding of cast iron to
produce machinable weld deposit. Also suitable for repairing of cracka filling up and
surtacing applications.
