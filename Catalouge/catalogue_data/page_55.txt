Characteristics  Applications 
Cellutherme-TOP1 is a light coated cellulosic type electrodes. The electrodes sare
characterized by a deeply penetrating forceful spray type arc and readily removable
thin friable slag Ideally suited for welding in all positions including vertical down. Ideal
for stove pipe technique and faster welding. Welds are of radiographic quality. It is
suitable for stringent pipeline welding requirements when tested for low temperature
impact toughness. Ideal for root pass welding of up to API SL X80 grade pipe and hot fill
and cap pass welding of up to. X65 grade pipe.
