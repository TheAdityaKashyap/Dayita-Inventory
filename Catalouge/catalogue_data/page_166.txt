Characteristics  Applications 
Cromotherme-20Mo is a low hydrogen iron power type electrode yielding a weld deposit
containing L.25%Cr-1.0%Mo-0.26%. The electrode produces stable and steady arc easy
striking and re-striking The slag is easily detachable. The welds are of radiographic
quality Ideal for welding CrMo- V steels of similar compositions filling up work on alloy
castings of similar compositions e.g. GS17CrMoV510. The weld metal possesses excellent
room temperature and elevated temperature properties.
