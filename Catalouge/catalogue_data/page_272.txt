CROMA
Secheron
Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
Croma is a AC/DC () type electrode depositing a 16%Cr-4%Mn weld metal which has
work hardening characteristics The weld metal resists impact abrasion and corrosion.
Ideally suited for hardfacing applications to enhance resistance to impact abrasion Ideal
for buffer layers before depositing air hardening deposits. Typical applications include
surfacing and building up of austenitic manganese steel components crusher jawe
crusher hammers roll crushers mining machineries. dipper teeth etc.
