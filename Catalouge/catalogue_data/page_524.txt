CAUSES AND REMEDIES FOR FUSION
WELD DISCONTINUITIES
CAUSES CORRECTIVE ACTION
Hydrogen Induced - Use low hydrogen welding electrode
cracking/Delayed cracking - Use suitable preheat and post weld
heat treatment.
Presence of brittle phases inthe - Soften the material before welding
micro structure of the
base material
Low ductility of the base material - Use preheat
Anneal the base metal
Use ductile weld metal
High residual stresses - Redesign the weld metal and reduce
restraints.
Change welding sequence
Use intermediate stress- relief heat
treatment
Excessive dilution - Change welding current
Use buttering technique wherever
possible
