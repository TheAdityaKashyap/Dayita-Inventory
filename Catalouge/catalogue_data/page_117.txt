Characteristics  Applications 
Nimotherme-NM2 is a basic coated low-hydrogen electrode. This electrode is intended ta
meet strength requirements after extended post weld heat treatment as required im the
construction of nuclear power plants and in the fabrication of components (e.g steam
generators and pressurizers) used in nuclear power plants. The weld metal fulfill the
requirements of drop weight testing to determine nil ductility temperature as well as
measurement of mils of lateral expansion on broken Charpy V-notch specimens.

Precautions
1. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour as per our standard recommended
practice.
2. Use short arc. stringer bead and smallest size of electrode minimum current ta
ensure minimum heat input.
