Characteristics  Applications 
Maxflux SAF-5 is an agglomerated basic type flux for welding general structural steels
presaure vessel steels pipe steels micro-alloved (BIS 8500)  fine grained eteels.
Recommended to use with high Mn wires (like EM12K and EH14) for better impact
properties. Slag detachahility is good. Weld is of radiographic quality with very low
diffusible hydrogen content. Maxflux SAP-4 is suitable for single  multi-layer welding of
structural welding pressure vessels boilers and other fabrications involving medium
tensile  low allov steel
