Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-39R is a low alloy stee Mux cored wive designed for welding of high strength fine
eramed quenched  tempered steels to meet sub-zero impact resistance property. The wire
gives optimum performance under CQ shielding and deposita radiographic quality weld
metal. The weld has excellent bead appearance and easy slag removal The wire sets low
diffusible hydrogen content (4m1/100gm) in the weld metal. Maxfil-39R is designed for
single and multi-pass welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels
like SA-203 Grade-K HY-80 H-100 HSLA-80 HSLA-100 ASTM A 316/A 516M-17
Gr.70 or equivalent where low temperature (at -46C) is required. This wire is used for
heavy fabrication work subjected to dynamic loading earth moving equipments off shore
platforms and similar kind of applications Penstock Fabrication
