Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-31B(Spl isa mild steel Mux cored wire suitable for all position welding with Argon-
CO gas shielding. The wire gives smooth burning characteristics low spatter and easy
slag removal. Filler contour is flat to slightly convex with equal leg lengths and uniform
sidewall fusion. The deposited weld metal is of radiographic quality. The deposited weld
metal contains very low diffusible hydrogen (5ml/100gms of weld metal) Maxfil-31B (Spl)
is designed for single and multi-pass welding of low and medium carbon steels grades like
(D E grades of SA-414 Gr.56 Gr.60 steels of SA-516 and equivalent grade steels ete.
