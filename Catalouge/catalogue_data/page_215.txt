EN ISO 3581-8
Characteristics  Applications 
Non-synthetic electrode depositing low carbon 28%Cr-31.5%Ni-3.7%Mo-1Cu fully
austenitic weld metal. Weld metal exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion in non-
oxidizing media like Sulfuric acid Phosphoric acid etc The elements C P and 3 are
maintained at low levels to eliminate hot cracking  fissuring problems in weld metal A
soft and smooth arc which is easy to strike and re-etrike. Easy slag detachability and well
rippled weld beads. The weld metal is of radiographic quality. Ideally suited for welding
stainless steels of similar composition and other equivalent grades of stainless steels.

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 01 hour.
2. Use stringer beads short arc and smallest possible size which helps in reducing the
heat input.
