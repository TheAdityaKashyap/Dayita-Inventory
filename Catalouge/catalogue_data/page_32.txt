OUR PROFILE
Ultratherme-P2 Designed to weld hot fill  cap
passes in high strength pipe but joints. Specifically
suited for API 5L pipes welding.
Nimotherme-NM1 is a low-hydrogen electrode
which contains about 1%Nickel and 0.6%
Molybdenum. This electrode can be welded without
PWHT.
Nimotherme-NM2 is a basic coated low-hydrogen
electrode. This electrode is intended to meet strength
requirements after extended post weld heat
treatment as required in the construction of nuclear
power plants.
2021 Rutox-G It is most often used to weld AISI Type 240
and 241 base metals These alloys are nitrogen-
strengthened austenitic stainless steels exhibiting
high strength with good toughness over a wide range
of temperatures.
Secheron-209 Jt is most often used to weld AISI
type 209 (UNS 520910) base metals. The alloy is a
nitrogen strengthened austenitic stainless steel
exhibiting high strength with good toughness over a
wide range of temperatures.
DH 20/18/6 Cu Is a stainless steel electrode
depositing an extra low carbon 20%Cr-18%%Ni-6%Mo-
O.7%Cu stainless steel weld metal. The weld metal
has excellent resistance to pitting and crevice
corrosion.
2021 DH 1414 (NS) provide excellent operating
characteristics for groove and fillet welding in down
hand position and smaller diameter electrodes are
suitable for all position welding.
DH 430 MC is a basic coated all position electrodes
depositing 17%%Cr-1.38%Mo.The weld metal shows good
corrosion resistibility and good oxidation resistibility.
2021 Maxfil-39R Low alloy steel flux cored wire for
welding of high strength fine grained quenched 
tempered steels to meet sub-zero impact resistance
property.
