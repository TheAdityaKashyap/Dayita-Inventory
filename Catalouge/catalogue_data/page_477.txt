Characteristics  Applications
Maxflux SAF-8 (PW) is an agglomerated Muoride-basic type flux suitable to weld medium
to high strength steels where very low diffusible hydrogen content good crack resistance
and higher sub-zero toughness properties are desired from the weld metal. The flux is
neutral in Mn  Si pick up and especially designed to meet the tensile  impact
requirements after post-weld heat treatment condition up to 7 hours of holding at 620C.
The weld deposit is of radiographic quality.Maxflux SAF-8 (PW) is suitable for single 
multi-layer welding of high tensile quenched  tempered steel fine grained steels heat
resistant structural steels nuclear sector fabrication etc.
