Characteristics  Applications 
DH 317-17 is a stainless steel electrode for welding steels of similar composition. It
works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic. Better welder appeal
including easy slag detachability characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds produce more
of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to concave It
has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no porosity. It is ideally suited
for welding stainless steele of similar composition and AISIS16L varieties and their
equivalents.
