Characteristics  Applications 
Non-synthetic rutile coated electrode depositing duplex stainless steel weld metal. Weld
metal consisting of austenite and ferrite matrix which pives good toughness and freedam
from weld cracking A soft and smooth arc which is easy to strike and re-strike Better
welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics The electrode can be used
where resistance to pitting corrosive attack and resistance to stress corrosion cracking are
required. The major application area includes oil  gas industry offshore platforms
petrochemical plants mechanical  structural components demanding high strength
together with high corrosion resistance.

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 250-300C for 1 hour.
2. Use stringer beads short arc and smallest possible size which helps in reducing the heat
input.
