OUR PROFILE
DH 2553(NS) Non-synthetic rutile coated electrode
depositing duplex stainless steel weld metal. The
electrode can be used where resistance to pitting
corrosive attack and resistance to stress corrosion
cracking are required.
2009 DH 20LR (NS) The elements C Si P and 5
maintained as low as possible and Nb Mn re
controlled to get better properties. The typical
applications include HV-9A stainless steel for
fabricating carpenter 20 stainless steels ete.
DH 385 It is particularly swited for welding
Carpenter 20 HV9 HV9A Uranus B6é UHB 904L
Sandvik 2RK65 and similar materials which are
used for these service conditions
Nitherme-1.5(5PL) Ideal for welding fine grained
and Nickel steels for service temperatures down to
-50C Typical applications include storage tanks for
liquefied gases like Ammonia distillers in coke oven
batteries and petrochemical industries. Conforming to
E8018-C4 classification.
DH 1212 (MOD) Electrode depositing
65%N1-20%Cr-2% Nb-1.5%Mo weld metal. It is ideally
suited for surfacing steel with Nickel-Chromium-Iron
alloy when high Manganese contents are not
detrimental for welding clad side of Nickel
Chromium-Iron clad steel and dissimilar metal
combinations. Suitable for overlay of forge plates.
Specially recommended for welding 9% Ni Steels for
eryogenic service.
110. 2010 DH 383 Non-synthetic electrode depositing low
carbon 28%Cr-31.5%N1-3.7%Mo-l fully austenitic
weld metal. Weld metal exhibits excellent resistance
to corrosion in non-oxidizing on-oxidizing media like
Sulfuric acid Phosphoric acid etc. Ideally suited for
welding stainless steels of similar composition and
Other equivalent grades of stainless steels
