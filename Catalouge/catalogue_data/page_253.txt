Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2209-17(N8) is a non-synthetic electrode depositing duplex stainless steel weld
metal Klectrode works well with transformer and good re-striking characteristic. Better
welder appeal including easy slag detachability characteristics On horizontal fillet
welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled weld bead and the bead shape is
typically flat to concave. It has no red hot tendency within current range specified and no
porosity. The weld metal possesses excellent corrosion resistance in marine  paper
environments. Suitable for welding duplex stainless steels having Crf25% and other
frades like UNS 32205 UNS 31802 ate.
