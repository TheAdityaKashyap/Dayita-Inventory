Characteristics  Applications 
DH 08H-17 is a stainless steel electrode depositing 19%Cr-10%Ni stainless steel weld
metal with carbon in the range of 0.04%-0.08% It works well with transformer and good re-
striking characteristic. Better welder appeal including easy slag detachability
characteristics. On horizontal fillet welds produce more of spray arc and a finer rippled
weld bead and the bead shape is typically flat to concave. Weld metal possesses excellent
crack resistance and displays good elevated temperature properties. Ideally suited for
joining 18/8 stainless stecls where the carbon content is in the range of 0.04%-0.08% i.e.
ATS 304H material.

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 800C for 2 hours.
2. Use short arc atringer bead and low current
3. Avoid build-up of heat during welding.
