Characteristics  Applications 
DH 310-15 is a basic coated 25% Cr-20%Ni type electrode for welding steels of similar
composition The weld metal has excellent resistance to oxidation and scaling up to
1200C. The electrode 1s also suitable for welding of hardenable steels clad steels (-Mo
Cr-Mo steels where pre-heat and post weld heat treatment are not feasible.
