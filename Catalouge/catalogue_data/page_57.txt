CELLUTHERME-P80 
Compile Welding Support
Codification 
Characteristics  Applications 
Cellutherme-P80 electrodes have been designed primarily for welding typical high-
strength pipe butt jomts in the vertical welding position with downward or upward
progression. This electrode operates with a forceful penetrating are and deposits a weld
metal of 0.15% Cr - 0.6%Ni - 0.95%.Mo steel. Extremely beneficial for welding of pipes in
Stove Pipe Technique both for faster welding and greater control on penetration of the
root runs. tis ideally suited for welding of API 5L-X65  APISL- X70 piping assemblies.
