Characteristics  Applications 
Anon-synthetic electrode depositing homogeneous Ni-Cr-Fe alloy composition. It is good
resistance to abrasion oxidation and corrosion. t is suitable for welding Ni-Cr-Fe alloys to
themselves dissimilar metals such as carbon steel 9%onickel steel stainless steel pure
nickle to themselves or to each other and for surfacing steel with Ni-Cr-Fe weld metal. It is
ideally suitable for welding Ni alloy UNS NO6600 tis also used for welding SS201LN type
materials to get good toughness together with strength.

Precautions 
1. Useshort arc and stringer beads.
2. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Readry the electrodes at 300-325C for 1 hour
3. Bestresults are obtained in flat position and wherever possible weld in flat position only-
