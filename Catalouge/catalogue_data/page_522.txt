CAUSES AND REMEDIES FOR FUSION
WELD DISCONTINUITIES
CAUSES
INCOMPLETE FUSION
mproper joint design
Presence of slag or oxide film
Incorrect electrode position
and operating current
Improper manipulation of arc
D INADEQUATE PENETRATION
1. Improper joint preparation
a) Excessively thick root face
b) Insufficient root opening
c Bridging of root opening
Electrode diameter too large
Inadequate current
(S) 91 9833550505
CORRECTIVE ACTION
Increase included angle of groove joint
Change the groove design
toa J or
aU type
Clean weld surfaces prior to welding
Maintain proper electrode position and
current
Use correct manipulation techniques to
melt the joint faces properly
Use proper joint geometry
Reduce root face height
Use wider root opening
Use smaller electrode in root
Increase root opening
Follow correct welding current and
technique
