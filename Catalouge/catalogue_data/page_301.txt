Characteristics  Applications 
DH 1423(N8) is an ideal non synthetic electrode for welding Ni-Cr-Mo alloys as well as
the clad side of joints in steel clad with a Ni-Cr-Mo alloy and for welding Ni-Cr-Mo alloys to
steal and to other nickel base alloys. t is suitable for welding components in plants for
chemical processes with highly corrosive media. Typical base materials which are welded
with this product are ASTM B574 B575 B619 B622 and B626 with UNS No. NoGOz2.
Ideal for C-22 alloys.
