Characteristics  Applications 
Norma-L is a medium coated general purpose all position mild steel electrode for welding
low carbon and mild structural steels t gives radiographic quality weld metal. The
electrode operates with a quiet arc and deposits a smooth bead with fine ripples. The slag
is easily detachable. The electrode produces minimum spatter and has good striking and
re-striking characteristics The electrode operates well under low OCY transformers.
Typical applications include welding of steel structures tanks truck frames and bodies
machinery construction auto bodies frames pipes ete
