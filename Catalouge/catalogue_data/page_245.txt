Characteristics  A
DH 17Cr is a heavy coated
pplications 
low hydrogen electrode depositing a weld metal containing
L7%Cr. The weld deposit displays good resistance to corrosion and heat. The electrode is
suitable for joining atainless
carbon steels low alloy steels
steels of similar composition. It 1s also suitable for surfacing
and chromium steels. Typical applications include surfacing
of valves impellers turbine blades etc.
