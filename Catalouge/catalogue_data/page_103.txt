Characteristics  Applications  a
Supratherme(SpU)H4R is a moisture resistant hydrogen controlled basic coated electrode
for producing tough and ductile weld of radiographic quality in boilers pressure vessels
medium carbon steels cast steel and problematic steels. The weld metal is clean and has
low level of impurities thus having unique properties. Some typical applications include
maintenance welding of all types of C-Mn steels heavy tensile steels heavy structures
plants  equipments subjected to static or dynamic loading. Typical Applications Include
Coaches Wagons Penstocks Boilers  Pressure vessels Barth moving machines ete.
