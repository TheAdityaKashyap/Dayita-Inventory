Codification 
ENISO 3581-4  EZ17MoB22
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 490 MC is a basic coated all position electrodes depositing 17%Cr-1.8%Mo. The weld
metal shows good corrosion resistibility and good oxidation resistibility. This electrode
requires suitable post and preheats treatment for obtaining optimum weld metal
properties. Weld metal retains hot hardness upto 500C and scaling resistant up to 900C
tis ideally suitable for wear resist surfacing on machine parts sealing faces of gas valves
impellers blades propeller shafts gas turbine. pump parts components ete.
