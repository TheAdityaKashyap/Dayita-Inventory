Characteristics  Applications 
Ultratensal-MH(H48) is moisture resistant hydrogen controlled basic coated
electrode The weld metal displays excellent crack resistance and produces sound weld
metal possessing excellent strength combined with good impact properties at sub zero
temperature. The electrode possesses excellent operating characteristics and is suitable
for welding in all positions. The extra low hydrogen content reduces susceptibility from
hydrogen induced cracking. It is suitable for welding high strength QT steels like WEL-
TEN 8054 517 grades and their equivalents. Ideally suited for welding highly restrained
joints in high strength steels under site conditions with high relative humidity.
