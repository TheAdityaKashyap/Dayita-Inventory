Characteristics  Applications 
DH 309LMo is a stainless steel electrode yielding a weld deposit of low carbon
26o0r-12%Ni-2.6%Mo which has good oxidation resistance up to 1050C t is ideally
suited for welding wrought and cast stainless steel of similar composition for overlay
applications to resist heat and corrosion overlays on ferritic steels buffer layers for
joining dissimilar steels such as 14-11-Mosteel to mild steel etc.
