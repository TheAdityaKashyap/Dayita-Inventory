Compile Welding Support
Characteristics  Applications 
DH 455 is a special purpose electrodes depositing almost pure iron weld metal which is
ideally suited for welding galvanizing baths. The very low silicon content ensures
excellent resistance to corrosion by molten zinc. Typical applications include welding of
galvanizing baths and filling up of worn out bodies of galvanizing bath to resist corrosion
by molten zinc.
