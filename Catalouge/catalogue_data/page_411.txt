Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-1101G6 is a low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high tensile
strength steel quenched  tempered steels etc. The weld metal also results good impact
resistance property at sub-zero temperatures. The wire gives optimum performance under
CO shielding with radiographic quality weld deposits. The weld has excellent bead
appearance and easy slag removal. Maxfil-1101G65 is designed for single and multi-pass
welding of similar composition steels and equivalent grade steels like HY-80 Sumiten-
610 C/D grades of SA-225 BC grades of 84-543 steels conforming to SA-612 grade A/BIC
grades of SA-738 etc
