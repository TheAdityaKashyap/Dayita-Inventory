MOLYTHERME-R
Codification 
 B63 BD1264
Characteristics  Applications 
Molytherme-R is a low hydrogen electrode yielding a weld deposit containing Mn-Mo. The
electrode is ideally suited for welding steels of similar composition CONCOR BOGIES ete.
The weld metal possesses good high temperature properties and has excellent toughness
The deposits will also meet the metal recovery of 110% min requirements
