Characteristics  Applications
Cromotherme-1(H4R) is basic coated low hydrogen moisture resistance type electrode.
Weld metal display remarkable strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures
up to 550C. Electrode is used for welding creep resistant 0.6%Cr - 0.5%Mo and 1%Cr
0.6%Mo steels. Typical applications include steam boiler construction welding of steam
and super-heater piping power plants oil refinery and chemical plants.
