Characteristics  Applications 
F Mn-Mo is a copper-coated solid wire for GTAW available in bright finish gives smooth
flow stable are and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. t gives radiographic
quality welds It is suitable for welding high strength fine-grained structural steels
containing 0.5% Mo The wire is also suitable for welding of penstock pipe-line fabrication
of earth moving equipments etc. where high tensile strength property is desired from the
weld metal Suitable for welding of ASTM steels SA-455/ S4-455M Gr.60 Gr.G5 steels of
SA-515/ SA-515M Gr.60 Gr.65 steels of SA-516/ SA-516M. Class 1 of A BC. D grades of
SA-53h/ SA-53.3M ate
