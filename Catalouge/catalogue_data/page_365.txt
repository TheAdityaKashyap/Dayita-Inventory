Characteristics  Applications 
FW 12501s a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives emooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality
welds. The weld metal possesses good resistance to corrosion by seawater chlorinated
solvents sulfuric acid and alkalies It is ideally suited for welding of monel-ta-monel Ni-
Cu alloys to themselves Ni-Cu alloy to steels for welding clad side of Ni-Cu clad steel and
for surfacing on steel parts. It is ideal for marine chemical food dairy and oil refining
industries.
