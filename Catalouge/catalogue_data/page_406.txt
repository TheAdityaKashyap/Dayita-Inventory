Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-81W is an all position low alloy steel flux cored wire designed for welding of high
strength weather-resistant prade steels. The wire gives optimum performance with
LOd%CO shielding and characterized with smooth metal transfer uniform welding even
on vertical-up stringer beads and easy slag removal. n fillet welds the bead contour is flat
to shghtly convex with equal leg lengths and uniform sidewall wetting. Weld metal 1s free
from porosity and conforms to X-ray soundness. Maxfil-81W is designed for single and
multi-pass welding of weather resistant steels - Corten steels grade A/B Class 1 steels of
type Aof SA-535 etc.
