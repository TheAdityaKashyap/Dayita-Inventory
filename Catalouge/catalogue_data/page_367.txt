Characteristics  Applications 
FW 1400 is a solid wire for TIG welding available in bright finish gives smooth flow
stable arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic
quality weld deposit Weld metal enhanced resistance to heat and strength up to 1000C
Weld metal has good thermal shock resistance hardness retention even at elevated
temperatures work hardening characteristics and corrosion resistance. It is auitable for
welding low carbon Ni-CrMo alloys clad side of low carbon Ni-CrMo alloys and alloys
of similar composition. Suitable for surfacing for increased resistance to abrasion
oxidation  corrosion Ideal for valves valve seats impellers puide points bushing
bearing journals hot working tools like hot shear blades forging dies trimming dies
piercing punches ete.
