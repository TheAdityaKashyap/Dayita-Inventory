Characteristics  Applications 
DH 2594(N5) is a non-synthetic electrode depositing super duplex stainless steel weld
metal. The weld metal exhibits high strength high impact energy and resistance to stress
corrosion cracking pitting and crevice corrosion. The weld metal possesses excellent
Corrosion resistance in marine  paper environments Examples of application areas are
Oil and gaz industry Off shore plat forms Petrochemical plants Mechanical and
structural components. It is suitable for welding. ASTM A890/A995 Gr. 54 CESMn UNS

Precautions 
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry Re-dry the electrodes at 240-500C for  hour
2. The heat input should be tn the range of 0.5.1.5 KAlinm.
3. Please ensure inter pass temperature is less than 140C and better less than 102C
1. For better results solution annealing at 1080-11 20C is required.
