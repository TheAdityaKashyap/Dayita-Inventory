Characteristics  Applications 
F Cr-Mo 91 is copper-coated a solid wire for GTAW yielding Cr - 1sMo and
modified with Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen designed to provide improved creep
strength toughness fatigue hfe oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated
temperatures. The wire gives stable arc smooth welding performance and deposits
radiographic quality welds F Cr-Mo 91 designed to weld the materials in power plant
refineries naptha cracker units etc. Following are some of the steels that can be welded
with this wire.
