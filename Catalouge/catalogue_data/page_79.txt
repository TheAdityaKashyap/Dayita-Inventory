Characteristics  Applications 
Supratherme-P2 is designed primarily for the welding of the hot fill and cap passes in
high strength pipe butt joints in the vertical position in upward progression. The low
hydrogen nature of the covering of these electrodes makes them especially suited for
joining crack-senaitive high strength pipe. Typical applications of these electrodes are the
welding of API SL pipe steels up to and including Grade X80 along with many other high
strength medium and high carbon and low-alloy steels.
