media. Typical base materials which are welded with
thisproduct are ASTM 8574 B575 BG19 B622 and
B626 with UNS No. NO6022. Ideal for C-22 alloys.
Rutox-B (Spl) It is a rutile coated electrode yielding
an extra low carbon (0.025% max) with ferrite (5-10
FN) in the weld metal. The weld metal has excellent
resistance to intergranular corrosion even at elevated
temperatures.
DH 1217 (NS) Control boron and zirconium are
helpful in reducing the tendency for ductility dip
cracking. It is ideally suited for welding the Ni-Cr-Fe
alloy of the UNS number NO06690. Typical
specifications for Ni-Cr-Fe base metals are ASTM
Bi66 Bis and 6168. Ideal for stringent
requirements in the construction of nuclear reactors
DH 1232 (NS) Typical specifications for the Cr-Ni-
Mo stainless steel base metal are A240 A167 A182
A249 A276 Ad12 AdSS8 AST3 and A479 most
particularly the grade UNS 541254 / 254 SMO / 6%
Mo 55 type. In a chloride containing environment the
fully austenitic weld-metal exhibits high resistance to
Pitting Crevice Corrosion  Stress Corrosion
Cracking. It is ideal for Sulphuric and Phosphoric
acid media that has been contaminated by chlorides.
It can also be used for welding of 625 and 825 grade
Ni-based alloys.
DH 1414 (NS) Weld metal gives good resistance to
the corrosion resistance to reducing oxidizing
crevice and pitting corrosion. It is suitable to join
duplex super duplex and super austenitic stainless
steel and ideally suitable for nickel alloys such a
Inconel alloy C-276 622 625 686 UN NO6059 and
NO6022
Unitherme-70 It is ideally suited for the fabrication
of carbon steels particularly fillet and butt welds for
faster deposition Electrodes are best suited for thicker
base metal. The higher metal recovery makes it the
ideal choice for heavy fabrication.
