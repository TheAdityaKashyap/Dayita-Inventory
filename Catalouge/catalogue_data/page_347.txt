Characteristics  Applications 
FW 308L is a solid wire for TIG process available in bright finish gives smooth flow stable
arc and spatter free under optimum welding conditions. It gives radiographic quality
welds. Wire contains low carbon 20%Cr-10%Ni The weld metal exhibits excellent
resistance to Intergranular Corrosion. tis ideally suited for welding of stainless steels of
similar composition like 304L and equivalents for overlays surfacing and repairing
castings of similar materials.
