Characteristics  Applications 
DH 455(LH) is a special purpose low hydrogen electrodes depositing almost pure iron
weld metal which is ideally suited for welding galvanizing baths. The very low silicon
content ensures excellent resistance to corrosion by molten zinc. Typical applications
include welding of galvanizing baths and filling up of worn out bodies of galvanizing bath
to resist carrosion by molten zinc.
