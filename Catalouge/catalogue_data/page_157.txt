Characteristics  Applications 
A low hydrogen iron powder electrode depositing 9%Cr -1%Mo weld metal modified with
Aluminium Niobium Vanadium and Nitrogen designed to provide improved creep
strength toughness fatigue life oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated
temperatures. It is designed to weld the materials in power plant and refineries. Following
are some of the steels that can be welded with this electrode. I) Plate A 387 Gr. 91 (1D)
Pipes A335- P91 (11D) Tubes A215-T91
