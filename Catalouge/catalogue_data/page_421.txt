Characteristics  Applications 
Maxfil-347 is stainless steel flux cored wire designed for optimum performance with
1L00%CO gas shielding. The weld metal is iCr-10%Ni with NbTa added as
stabilizer This wire is designed with fast freezing slag characteristics and good slag
detachability. The wire welds satisfactory when welding in the flat  horizontal position
The weld metal is of radiographic quality and to obtain resistance to intergranular
corrosion due to carbon precipitation without the use of stabilizers. Maxfil-347 is designed
for welding of similar composition steels like AISI 304 304L 421 347 type and their
equivalents with excellent weld ability.
