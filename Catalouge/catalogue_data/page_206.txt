Characteristics  Applications 
DH 312 is a rutile type electrode which can be considered as outstanding by virtue of its
excellent performance characteristics and weld metal of controlled chemical composition
The weld metal is highly resistant to crack and fissures. These electrodes were designed to
weld cast alloys of similar composition The typical application include welding dissimilar
metals unknown metals leaf and coil springs gear teeth forged shafts earth moving
equipment and machine parts.
