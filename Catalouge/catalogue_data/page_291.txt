Characteristics  Applications 
Anon-synthetie nickel base electrode depositing weld metal of Ni-Cr-Mo-Co-Ti-W alloys.
The weld deposit resists corrosion resistance at room temperature as well as resistance to
oxidation and reducing atmospheres at elevated temperatures. Electrodes are used for
welding Ni-Cr-Mo alloy for the welding of the clad side of joints in steel clad with Ni-Cr-Mo
alloy and for joining Ni-Cr-Mo alloys to steel and to other nickel base alloys. Some of the
materials which are welded with these electrodes are ASTM B 574.B 575 B 619 B 622
and B 626 having UNS number N 06985.

Precautions
1. Ensure the electrodes are dry. Re-dry the electrodes at 300-4325C for 1 hour.
2. Operate the electrodes wherever possible weld in flat position only.
4. Maintain a short arc use stringer bead and minimize the heat input.
