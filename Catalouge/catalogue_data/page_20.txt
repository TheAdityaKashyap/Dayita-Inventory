OUR PROFILE
Cromotherme-1L(Mod) Electrodes suitable for
welding 1.25%Cr-0.5%Mo creep resisting steel. The
weld metal possesses excellent tensile strength
together with toughness even at -20C. Conforming to
ETO18B2-L classification.
Batox-D (NP) Basic coated electrode yielding
0.05%C-18%0Cr-12%Ni-2.3%Mo-N weld deposit.
Conforming to IGCAR Specification
PFBR/30000/1032/SP/R-1.
Nitherme-2.5L A low hydrogen electrode depositing
2.5%Ni in the weld metal. Weld metal possesses
excellent toughness at sub-zero temperatures down to
-73C Conforming to E 7018-C1L classification.
Molytherme-Spl The weld metal possesses high
strength together with good notch toughness even at
subzero temperature down to -50C.
Cellutherme-Mo Deeply penetrating forceful spray
type are electrode to yield 0.4%Mo weld deposit.
DH25/10/4W Conforming to E2595-16 for use
primarily to weld duplex stainless steels which
contain approximately 25%6Cr
Cromotherme-2L (Mod)  It is used for welding
P22/T22 low carbon version. It gives low hardness
and consistent sub zero impact toughness even
